10.3390/jintelligence12060055,"This study was to investigate the relationship between metacognition and the mathematical modeling skills of high school students, as well as the mediating role of computational thinking. A cluster sampling method was adopted to investigate 661 high school students, using the metacognition scale, computational thinking scale, and mathematical modeling skill test questions. The results showed that metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive monitoring had a direct and positive correlation with high school students' mathematical modeling skills. Additionally, the critical thinking dimension of computational thinking mediated the relationship between metacognitive knowledge, experience, monitoring, and mathematical modeling skills. These findings indicated that sufficient metacognition could improve the critical thinking of high school students' computational thinking and enhance their mathematical modeling skills.

10.1177/21582440241249897,"Problem-solving skills are an ability that must be cultivated to equip students with the skills needed to deal with today's increasingly complex and volatile environment. Computational thinking represents a new paradigm in problem-solving skills. After Wing proposed Computational Thinking as problem-solving skills in 2006, other scholars investigated this topic; nevertheless, the link between Computational Thinking and problem-solving has not been clearly discussed in previous studies. To uncover evidence for the connection between Computational Thinking and problem-solving skills, we conduct a systematic literature review of 37 papers collected from Web of Science database. The results indicate that (a) problem-solving is discussed in the 37 articles in the context of Computational Thinking, (b) the most frequently employed Computational Thinking stages in problem-solving skills are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, (c) Computational Thinking is closely linked to problem-solving, and (d) Computational Thinking and problem-solving stages serve the same functions in solving problems. The results of this study will encourage the development of education research, particularly in the application of CTas a problem-solving tool in various real-life scenarios.

10.1007/s11528-023-00841-1,"Educational robotics has been adopted to create interactive and engaging learning environments to develop computational thinking (CT) in K-12 learners. This study systematically examined 22 peer-reviewed empirical research articles on the use of educational robotics to develop CT in young learners (pre-kindergarten to 6th grade) published between 2012 and 2021. The findings revealed that using robotics activities to develop CT has mostly been studied in the formal education settings with the duration of robotics curricular activities ranging from 80 minutes to 24 hours. The five CT skills studied most often include Sequencing, Conditionals, Loops, Debugging, and Algorithmic Thinking. The different versions of LEGO Mindstorms are the most frequently adopted robotic kits in the examined studies. The most frequently adopted learning and instructional strategies in the robotics activities include collaborative learning, project-based learning, and embodied learning. This paper identified and discussed developmentally appropriated CT skills, robotics kits, and pedagogical approaches suitable for supporting CT development in young learners. The findings can guide educators and instructional designers for future robotics activity design and development endeavors. This paper also identified gaps in the current research and recommended directions for advancing research in adopting robotics to develop CT in young learners.

10.18421/TEM132-56,"Technological progress has brought about modifications in the educational process. This transformation has led to numerous technological innovations for supporting student learning, with smartphones being one of the prominent tools. Despite the widespread use, students have primarily used smartphones for online gaming and social media, leading to a decline in the effectiveness for educational purposes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how students in electronics engineering education responded to a novel technology, augmented reality (AR), when integrated into the fundamental learning process, in order to maximize the utility of smartphones. A cross-sectional survey approach with a quantitative methodology comprising 101 students in the field of electronics engineering education in higher education institutions in Indonesia was adopted. Data were collected through a questionnaire, which was subsequently analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) method with SmartPLS 3 software. Additionally, this study used Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method to examine the influence of each cluster values on the others. The analytical results showed that Computational Thinking Skill (CTS) of students significantly impacted Actual System Use (ASU) of AR. Furthermore, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) of this technology played crucial roles as mediators in ASU of AR.

10.1007/s10643-023-01475-x,"Researchers are increasingly calling for more computational thinking (CT) teaching tools and activities designed for young children. Considering young children's need to draw on their bodily experiences to learn abstract concepts, this study applied the embodied cognition perspective to design an unplugged (non-computer-based) toolkit with activities that foster CT. This study aimed to explore young children's experiences in unplugged activities. Specifically, children's perceptions about the activities were investigated, and their embodied interactions during the activities were analyzed to reveal how CT emerges as an embodied phenomenon. Results indicate that children had positive perceptions about the activities. In addition, young children's algorithmic thinking and debugging emerged most frequently. Furthermore, this study found that CT extended to both the unplugged toolkit and children's bodies and emerged in perception-action loops. This research provides insight into the instructional design of young children's CT and helps researchers understand how young children develop CT from an embodied cognition perspective.

10.1371/journal.pone.0309412,"Computational thinking (CT) is a set of problem-solving skills with high relevance in education and work contexts. The present paper explores the role of key cognitive factors underlying CT performance in non-programming university students. We collected data from 97 non-programming adults in higher education in a supervised setting. Fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and visuospatial ability were assessed using computerized adaptive tests; CT was measured using the Computational Thinking test. The direct and indirect effects of gender and visuospatial ability through fluid intelligence on CT were tested in a serial multiple mediator model. Fluid intelligence predicted CT when controlling for the effects of gender, age, and visuospatial ability, while crystallized intelligence did not predict CT. Men had a small advantage in CT performance when holding the effects of cognitive abilities constant. Despite its large correlation with gender and CT, visuospatial ability did not directly influence CT performance. Overall, we found that programming-naive computational thinkers draw on their reasoning ability that does not rely on previously acquired knowledge to solve CT problems. Visuospatial ability and CT were spuriously associated. Drawing on the process overlap theory we propose that tests of fluid intelligence and CT sample an overlapping set of underlying visuospatial processes.

10.11594/ijmaber.05.03.05,"Computational thinking is increasingly acknowledged as important in education to support the development of problem-solving skills in mathematics. Pattern recognition plays a significant role in solving mathematical problems using computational thinking. This qualitative research explores how students recognize patterns when solving mathematical problems using computational thinking. The study adopts a case study approach, with 46 subjects then chooses two students from the Mathematics Education Study Program selected through purposive sampling. Data collection methods involve tests and interviews in August. The data is qualitatively analyzed, involving reduction, data presentation, and concluding the research findings. The results indicate that the subjects recognized a pattern related to determining the height of a triangle, which was one of the assigned questions. The pattern emerged as the subjects identified the problem, decomposed it, recognized known and unknown information, and identified the relationship between sub-problems and task information. The identified pattern is crucial in addressing the problem in the given task.

10.47743/jopafl-2023-30-11,"Computational thinking, defined as a way of thinking that can be applied to various fields that require problem-solving skills, has become prevalent in education. Students, i.e., future specialists, have to be prepared for complex thinking competence, necessary for solving business and societal problems, for which a combination of mathematical thinking and computational thinking is essential. The preliminary premise is that there is a correlation between ability in specific mathematical and computational fields. Therefore, this paper aims to highlight the significance of investigating the relations between those fields from linguistic point of view. In order to better understand the relationship between abilities in specific mathematical and computational fields, this paper presents an analysis of a new approach, namely, developing hypotheses for exploring the relationship between metalanguages of different fields of Mathematics and Computer Science.

It was seen that the experimental and control group's computational thinking skills differed significantly in creativity and algorithmic thinking dimensions. There is a significant difference in attitude toward mathematics regarding study and requirements. Computer-based mathematical activities have positively affected the creativity and algorithmic thinking dimensions of computational thinking. These activities have improved the anxiety and study dimensions of the attitude toward mathematics. These activities should be developed more and disseminated.

10.1007/s11423-023-10231-2,"Computational thinking (CT) has permeated primary and early childhood education in recent years. Despite the extensive effort in CT learning initiatives, few age-appropriate assessment tools targeting young children have been developed. In this study, we proposed Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primary (CTtLP), which was designed for lower primary school students (aged 6–10). Based on the evidence-centred design approach, a set of constructed-response items that are independent of programming platforms was developed. To validate the test, content validation was first performed via expert review and cognitive interviews, and refinements were made based on the comments. Then, a large-scale field test was administered with a sample of 1st–3rd graders (N = 1225), and the data was used for psychometric analysis based on both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). The CTT results provided robust criterion validity, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability values. Regarding IRT results, a three-parameter logistic model was selected according to the item fit indices, based on which fair item parameters and test information reliability were generated. Overall, the test items and the whole scale showed proper fit, suggesting that CTtLP was a suitable test for the target group. Analyses of the test performance were then put forward. Results reported that students' performance improved with grade level, and no gender difference was detected. Based on the test responses, we also identified children's challenges in understanding CT constructs, indicating that students tended to have difficulty in understanding loop control and executing multiple directions. The study provides a rigorously validated diagnostic test for measuring CT acquisition in lower primary school students and demonstrates a replicable design and validation process for future assessment practices, and findings on the difficulties children faced in CT conceptual understanding could shed light on CT primary and early childhood education.

By utilizing the concept of mathematical modelling, students may be able to develop a more grounded understanding of mathematics. The objective of this research was to explore how computational thinking and critical thinking are connected to the mathematical modelling proficiency of pre-service teachers. Correlational quantitative research was conducted on 140 pre-service mathematics teachers from the Institute of Teacher Education, Penang and the Institute of Teacher Education, Ipoh, using a correlational research design. Using cluster random sampling, the Institute of Teacher Education was selected at random. The results revealed that pre-service mathematics teachers exhibited a strong aptitude for computational and critical thinking, but demonstrated a limited level of proficiency in mathematical modelling. In terms of modelling proficiency, the results indicated a significant correlation between computational thinking and critical thinking. The findings from this research demonstrated a significant correlation between critical thinking, computational thinking, and proficiency in modelling. Therefore, computational thinking and critical thinking improve prospective mathematics teachers' modelling skills.

To this end, the Computational Thinking Test for Junior High Students (CTT-JH) was developed and validated. Research participants included 437 junior high school students in Taiwan. The surveyed schools were categorized into more or fewer ICT resources. Then, discrimination analyses and Rasch modeling for item analyses and two-way ANOVA were conducted. Results showed that the final version of CTT-JH is of good item quality. Students in schools with more ICT resources had higher CT test mean scores regardless of gender. Nevertheless, at schools with limited resources, male students had significantly lower CT test mean scores than female students did. This study provides new insights into how gender and ICT resources can interact with and impact on students' CT competencies. It also provides a valid and reliable tool for assessing young adolescents' CT abilities.

10.30191/ETS.202307_26(3).0012,"This paper describes the implementation and student learning outcomes of a nationwide professional development program for lower secondary and upper secondary school teachers to integrate computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum. Computational thinking comprises important concepts and skills that all students should develop to take an active role in a global society. However, teaching computational thinking is challenging. There are few teachers with the knowledge and skills to integrate computation into their courses. In this program, the participating teachers implemented a set of lesson plans that included both unplugged activities to scaffold student learning, and 'plugged' activities following a use-modify-create learning progression with the Micro:bit device to practice these skills. The study used a quasi-experimental design to compare students' level of computational thinking between the program participants and a control group. The results suggest a positive effect of the learning activities on student computational thinking knowledge and skills as compared to the control group. This result persists after controlling for school context and student gender. This study provides an explicit approach to implementing these activities in the context of a developing country and assesses their effectiveness in a large-scale study.

Software (SW) education and physical computing education are frequently addressed topics in technology education, but education about computational thinking (CT) lacks interest and research. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop educational programs in technology. In this study, we developed a program integrating CT, which centered on technological problem-solving processes. The program comprised 12 total hours of hacking a remote control (RC) car using Micro:bit development tool. This study investigates the effects of the developed program with a single group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design. Nineteen students participated in the study, completing survey instruments that measure CT competency and attitudes toward CT and technology, answering an open-ended questionnaire, and voluntarily took part in semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the technological problem-solving program positively affected participants' CT-related competencies. Moreover, we observed improvement in participants' attitudes toward technology due to the integration of CT into their technology education classes. This study provides a strong case for incorporating CT into technology education. It also suggests future research direction regarding the development of students' CT competencies in various technological problem-solving contexts.

To achieve this goal, an experimental research design with a pre-test and post-test control group was used as a quantitative research method. The study group of the research consisted of a total of 124 participants randomly selected from 70 experimental and 54 control students at Bingöl Central Gazi Middle School in the school year 2021-2022. The ""Levels of Computational Thinking Scale"" was used to measure students' computational thinking skills, and the ""Attitude Scale toward Coding for Middle School Students"" was used to measure their attitude toward coding. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical program. The results show that while Block-Based Gamified Learning had no effect on computational thinking skills, it did have a positive effect on attitudes toward coding. Block-Based Gamified Learning has the potential to have a positive impact on overcoming barriers to interest, motivation, and learning. However, it is important to consider the potential limitations of block-based gamified learning and to familiarize students with different programming languages and tools for their future programming studies.

10.1111/bjet.13443,"To date, extensive work has been devoted to incorporating computational thinking in K‐12 education. Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game‐based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game‐based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle‐based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem‐solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K‐12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Game‐based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K‐12 education.Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit.Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game‐based learning environments.What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage‐based implicit learning with machine learning methods.Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real‐time gameplay actions.High‐performing students can develop practical problem‐solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low‐performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices.Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game‐based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages.Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games.Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected.

10.1111/jcal.12996,"Background: Artificial intelligence–generated content (AIGC) has stepped into the spotlight with the emergence of ChatGPT, making effective use of AIGC for education a hot topic. Objectives: This study seeks to explore the effectiveness of integrating AIGC into programming learning through debugging. First, the study presents three levels of AIGC integration based on varying levels of abstraction. Then, drawing on extended effective use theory, the study proposes the underlying mechanism of how AIGC integration impacts programming learning performance and computational thinking. Methods: Three debugging interfaces integrated with AIGC by ChatGPT were developed for this study according to three levels of AIGC integration design. The study conducts a between‐subject experiment with one control group and three experimental groups. Analysis of covariance and a structural equation model are employed to examine the effects. Results and Conclusions: The results show that the second and third levels of abstraction in AIGC integration yield better learning performance and computational thinking, but the first level shows no difference compared to traditional debugging. The underlying mechanism suggests that the second and third levels of abstraction promote transparent interaction, which enhances representational fidelity and consequently impacts learning performance and computational thinking, as evidenced in test of the mechanism. Moreover, the study finds that learning fidelity weakens the effect of transparent interaction on representational fidelity. Our research offers valuable theoretical and practical insights. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter?: In the present information era, programming and computational thinking are important.AIGC has attracted remarkable attention from both academics and managers.If it is appropriately utilised, AIGC can facilitate education.

10.1111/jcal.13041,"Background Objectives Methods Results and conclusions Implications Computational thinking is derived from arguments that the underlying practices in computer science augment problem‐solving. Most studies investigated computational thinking development as a function of learners' factors, instructional strategies and learning environment. However, the influence of the wider community such as educational policies on computational thinking remains unclear.This study examines the impact of basic and technology‐related educational policies on the development of computational thinking.Using supervised machine learning, the computational thinking achievements of 31,823 eighth graders across nine countries were analysed. Seven rule‐based and tree‐based classification models were generated and triangulated to determine how educational policies predicted students' computational thinking.Predictions show that students have a higher propensity to develop computational thinking skills when schools exercise full autonomy in governance and explicitly embed computational thinking in their curriculum. Plans to support students, teachers and schools with technology or introduce 1:1 computing have no discernible predicted influence on students' computational thinking achievement.Although predictions deduced from these attributes are not generalizable, traces of how educational policies affect computational thinking exist to articulate more fronts for future research on the influence of educational policies on computational thinking.

10.1111/jcal.13038,"Background Objectives Methods Results and Conclusions Implications The pedagogy of computational thinking has gained extensive traction across numerous nations globally, with a particular emphasis on nurturing computational thinking in the formative years of early childhood. Nevertheless, the efficacy of diverse instructional approaches in the domain of programming education, with regards to fostering the advancement of computational thinking abilities in young children, remains a subject of ongoing debate.The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of programming education in fostering computational thinking skills in young children. The central focus revolves around a meticulous exploration of the influence exerted by diverse modalities of programming education on the cultivation of computational thinking abilities in early learners.A total of 32 empirical studies were incorporated into the analysis. Out of these, 77 effect sizes were deemed to meet the predefined inclusion criteria for the present study. The statistical analysis was executed utilizing Stata version 17.0 software.The acquisition of programming skills can enhance the advancement of computational thinking in young children (Hedges's g = 0.49, 95% confidence interval [0.40, 0.58]), thereby yielding a moderate effect. When considering the triad of programming education modalities, it becomes evident that graphical programming surpasses both tangible programming and unplugged programming in terms of its efficacy in fostering the growth of computational thinking in young learners.The foregoing contributes significantly to the systematic cultivation and augmentation of computational thinking skills in young children. It establishes a foundational framework for early childhood educators and instructional tool designers to effectively and purposefully impart programming knowledge to children.

However, the most significant impediment to the long-lasting development of students’ CT is teachers’ lack of CT and positive programming attitudes (PA). Therefore, this research aimed to explore the effects of Micro: bit programming training activities on STEM teachers’ CT and PA. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with 55 elementary STEM teachers that included 12 Micro: bit programming training activities and measured changes in teacher CT and PA levels using the TCTS and TPAS. The results revealed that Micro: bit programming training activities effectively enhanced STEM teachers’ CT and PA. Further analysis showed that Micro: bit programming training activities mainly improved problem-solving and creativity in CT and cognition and beliefs in PA of STEM teachers. Meanwhile, we found that Micro: bit programming training activities benefited CT and PA enhancement for STEM teachers with high educational level and low teaching years. Furthermore, the findings indicated a partially mediated effect of STEM teachers’ PA in terms of educational level affecting CT, and teachers’ teaching years also significantly moderated the second half of this mediated effect. Generally, this research expands the training approaches of CT and PA for elementary school STEM teachers while clarifying the multifactorial influence mechanisms related to CT and PA, which can provide practical references for future STEM teacher training.

10.1007/s11423-024-10364-y,"Computational thinking (CT) has received growing interest as a research subject in the last decade, with research contributions attempting to capitalize on the benefits that CT may provide. This study included a systematic analysis aimed at revealing current trends in the CT subject, identifying educational interventions, and emerging assessment instruments. It also gave an overview of how teachers learned CT skills and how they integrated the CT curriculum into classroom practices. We searched the data in the Web of Science database and identified 360 articles. Most importantly, it emphasized the following points: (a) the most popular subject areas in CT literature; (b) CT intervention tools; (c) CT assessment practices used so far within educational courses; and (d) effective CT approaches to influence pre-service teachers. Results from this review revealed that CT's promotion in education had achieved significant progress in recent years. Along with the growth in the number of CT studies, the number of subjects, research questions, and teaching approaches also increased in recent years. It was also found that CT was mostly used in science, mathematics, programming, and computer science tasks, with little work in artificial intelligence (AI) and non-STEM areas. The essence of this paper implicated the researchers in designing the curriculum based on different subject domains. Furthermore, we recommended integrating augmented reality-based games using CT methodologies into the curriculum.

The project produced a list of CT skills and definitions that students use to predict the weather, CT assessment instruments, and a CT classroom observation protocol. Data was collected from 306 eighth grade (ages 13–14) students in rural indigenous communities in the Artic and urban and suburban Northeast communities in the USA. The project met its goal of producing an intentional instructional sequence that integrates disciplinary science and CT practices to increase students' science knowledge and their ability to use CT skills and processes. The results indicate that teachers were able to use the curriculum to embed CT practices into the classroom. Students, in turn, had the opportunity to practice using these skills in class discussion as evidenced by the classroom observation data, and students' science knowledge of CT content and practices significantly increased as evidenced by their performance on the weather content and CT skills pre- and post-assessments. While statistically significant gains in science knowledge and CT skills and practices were evident in all settings (urban, suburban, and rural indigenous communities), there were noticeable differences in gains in students' CT skills and practices between the three settings and additional research is needed in a diversity of settings to understand this difference.

The study’s goal is to present an algorithm for precisely and computationally classifying works of children’s literature. The Content Analysis research method was used to analyze the color classification table in the document Guide for the standardization of Vila Velha school libraries network. Three analytical categories were developed a posteriori using the critical thinking skill. The study’s findings revealed three inaccuracies in the color classification table, namely: mutual coverage in classification; incompatibility in the genus-species relationship; incompatibility with the nature of information thematic representation. An algorithm was presented that allows for the precise and computational classification of works of children’s literature. The study concludes that computational thinking can be a process that organizes library classification activity, ensuring accuracy in information thematic representation due to the logical-computational character amalgamated throughout the process flow.

10.1007/s11423-022-10182-0,"Echoing the increasing emphasis on STEM literacy, computational thinking has become a national priority in K-12 schools. Scholars have acknowledged abstraction as the keystone of computational thinking. To foster K-12 students' computational thinking and STEM literacy, students' ability to think abstractly should be enhanced. However, the existing curriculum in K-12 education may not adequately equip learners with the proper abstraction needed for the STEM workforce. Given the absence of a synthesized understanding of abstraction, effective instructional guidance for fostering student abstraction is also elusive. To overcome the gap in understanding abstraction, we attempted to conceptualize a synthesized framework of abstraction in computational thinking and proposed a set of design guidelines that may enhance students' uptake of abstraction. In this paper, we describe the importance of abstraction in computational thinking and existing challenges in developing students' ability to perform abstraction. Then, by reviewing the cognitive dimensions of abstraction and the role of abstraction in computing education, we identify three cognitive processes underlying abstraction in computational thinking (e.g., filtering information, locating similarities, and mapping problem structures). We thereby propose a conceptual framework of abstraction in computational thinking. Finally, design guidelines for fostering abstraction in computational thinking are provided with illustrated examples of a tailored STEM-integrative learning environment.

Data were gathered through observation, interviews, and portfolio documents. The data are analyzed through six stages: preparing and organizing, exploring, building descriptions, representing the findings, interpreting the results, and validating the accuracy. The result indicated four primary computational thinking skills: decomposition, abstraction, simulation, and evaluation. The computational thinking skills in physics learning can develop students’ understanding and implementation of physics concepts based on data, not just mathematical formulas. Computational thinking in physics learning gives students the opportunity and space to explore and develop their ideas and logical reasoning more deeply in problem-defining, solutions, and evaluation. Students use their logical reasoning to solve the problem precisely. This study is expected to be used as a basis and support for physics teachers to integrate computational thinking into their learning classroom.

10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0011,"Given the importance of digital technology in daily life, computational thinking (CT) has become a necessary skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. For CT development, students need to receive appropriate social learning support. However, instructors find it difficult to provide such support to many students in online courses. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of e-mentoring via social network services (SNS) in developing students' CT during large-scale online courses. A total of 327 undergraduate students volunteered to participate in this study, which included 16 weeks of lectures aimed at developing CT. The effects of SNS-based e-mentoring on CT development, the influences of each e-mentoring activity on CT development, and gender differences were analyzed using data on participants' CT assistance scores and their utilization of e-mentoring activities. The findings indicated that SNS-based e-mentoring was effective in developing the CT of undergraduate students' engagement in a large-scale online course. The most influential ementoring activities for students' CT development were informational and technical support in a group and informational support in a private environment. Female students benefited more from SNS-based e-mentoring than male students, and they also engaged in more types of e-mentoring activities than male students. Participation in SNS-based e-mentoring was found to lower the gap in CT between students with and without prior learning experience. Our study findings can be used by educational institutions and instructors when designing courses for students' CT development in large-scale online courses or when developing strategies to close the gender gap in CT ability.

10.5753/rbie.2023.2856,"Computational Thinking (CT) expands students' creativity as they generate diverse and unique ideas, inducing a better understanding of other knowledge areas. In this way, the present work aims to identify the bases for computational thinking application, its taxonomies, and the main challenges in the curricular adjustment for CT use with primary education children, considering sixth-year students of Elementary School in the Bagé-RS region. Three public and three private schools participated in this study and the research instrument adopted was a questionnaire, divided into three thematic axes: adoption of computational resources in pedagogical practices, institutional maturity on the CT theme, and pedagogical of educational institution practices. In these teacher views, in addition to the theoretical basis and technical aspects of CT tools, a new curricular proposal needs to consider usability issues, student motivation, teacher facilitation through resources, the institutions structures available, and evaluation ways. In addition, exploring the relationship between CT tools and development is necessary, providing information on which tools can best support learning strategies. The project advances constitute the specific training proposition in the Computational Thinking area aimed at the research participants. Therefore, future activities begin with the group composition involving the Municipal Government, the Regional Coordination of Education, and the representatives appointed by the educational institutions.

In mathematics classrooms, there are few explanations of the ways CT can support students in formulating and solving complex problems. This paper presents an example of a primary classroom investigation (8‐9 year olds) over seven lessons of the problem ""How long does it take to read a book?"" The aim is to illustrate ways a statistical investigation can provide context for CT and demonstrate how the two complement each other to solve problems involving mathematics. The findings highlight opportunities and challenges that students face across the elements of CT—decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and modelling, and generalization and algorithmic thinking, including recommendations for teaching.

10.1007/s11423-022-10161-5,"Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students' understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n = 21) and the control (n = 26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students' CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students' CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.

10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0012,"Computational thinking (CT) is an imperative competency in the 21st century. Mindtools can assist students in understanding concepts and decomposing tasks during CT development through programming. However, students may encounter challenges in complex CT problem-solving tasks due to being confused when using mindtools without proper guidance. Research evidence shows the potential of reflection in complex CT problem-solving by regulating cognitive activities. Accordingly, this study designed a reflection-guided visualized mindtool strategy to address CT development challenges. A quasi-experiment and lag sequential analysis were conducted by recruiting 97 junior high school students to examine the effects of the proposed strategy on CT development and to explore students' behavior patterns. Results revealed that the proposed approach improved students' CT performance, CT disposition, meta-cognitive awareness, and learning motivation. Students learning with the proposed strategy exhibited more key behaviors of facilitating CT problem-solving (e.g., generalizing the knowledge, re-designing the algorithm scheme, and evaluating the feasibility of their proposed schemes) than students in the control group, revealing the essential process of CT development and enlightening teachers on guiding students to produce such learning processes when cultivating CT.

10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0010,"Grounded in problem-based learning and with respect to four mathematics domains (arithmetic, random events and counting, number theory, and geometry), we designed a series of programming-based learning tasks for middle school students to co-develop computational thinking (CT) and corresponding mathematical thinking. Various CT concepts and practices articulating the designated mathematical problems were involved in the tasks. In addition to delineating the design of these learning tasks, this paper presents a qualitative study in which we examined 74 students' learning outcomes and characterized their CT and mathematical thinking co-development as they accomplished the tasks. The research results demonstrate the codevelopment of both mathematics- and CT-related concepts and practices in the four mathematics domains. Two types of interactions are identified: (i) applying mathematical knowledge to construct CT artifacts and (ii) generating new mathematical knowledge with CT practice. The new insights provided by the present work are threefold. First, from a mathematical learning perspective, the nature of the solution processes of the designed problems should not be immediately obvious. Second, from a technology-enhanced learning perspective, the dynamic representations and immediate visual feedback afforded by the programming tool are beneficial to student learning. Third, from a pedagogical perspective, the room for customization offered by both the designed problems and programming tools can provide affordances for learning.

A systematic review of academic and grey literature has been conducted to analyse the state of the art in implementing CT in primary and secondary education. In total, 1977 publications were identified, out of which 98 met the inclusion criteria for the review. The results show that, despite a lack of consensus on a common definition, a core set of key CT skills is addressed in primary and lower secondary education. Implementation approaches that emerged from the analysis are discussed and presented according to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (2016) classification: (i) embedding CT across the curriculum as a transversal theme/skill set; (ii) integrating CT as a separate subject; and (iii) incorporating CT skills within other subjects such as Mathematics and Technology. New approaches to formative assessment of CT are emerging, reflecting different conceptualisations and differences in contextual and motivational aspects of CT curriculum integration. However, further investigation is needed to understand better how gender/equity/inclusion issues impact the quality of computing education integration.

10.1111/jcal.12972,"Background: A resurgence in teaching coding in primary school classrooms has led to a pedagogical swing towards using physical computing and coding to develop students' use of algorithms, computational thinking, and problem‐solving skills. Two obstacles impede the optimal development of these objectives: the availability of a suitable pedagogy and an instructional sequencing model for primary school teachers to effectively present coding and computational thinking concepts and skills to students in alignment with their developmental stage. Objective: This study aims to address both obstacles by introducing the 3C Model, a newly developed instructional sequence grounded in established pedagogies and designed to effectively teach coding and computational thinking skills to primary school students based on their developmental stage. Methods: The qualitative study employed two data sources to triangulate findings, using: (1) semi‐structured interviews and thematic analysis to investigate 11 primary school students' perceptions of their learning experiences with the 3C Model, and (2) researcher observations along with reflections of the students' developed and demonstrated learning through the method of knowing‐in‐action, reflection‐in‐action, and reflection‐on‐action. Results and Conclusions: The findings of this study fill a gap in the existing literature by demonstrating that the pedagogical and sequential approach embedded in the 3C Model not only enhanced students' engagement levels but also resulted in improved curriculum learning outcomes. The 3C Model provides teachers with a coherent and age‐appropriate instructional structure. It uses physical computing devices and digital coding platforms to introduce coding concepts, furthering the development of computational thinking skills in primary school students beyond mere procedural and rote learning. Implications: The study holds important implications for practical applications, as it addresses an absence in the literature of an established pedagogy and instructional sequencing model for effectively teaching coding and computational thinking concepts and skills to primary school students. Drawing on established pedagogical and developmental learning theories, the 3C Model provides primary school teachers with an engaging, age‐appropriate instructional method that avoids decontextualised teaching and surface‐based learning. Instead, it encourages collaborative student work and contextualised learning, steering away from isolated and generic approaches. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic: Teaching coding and computational thinking concepts and skills is complex due to their abstract nature.Teaching resources such as work samples, curriculum connections and tools are available to primary school teachers.There is no consensus on the most effective methods to teach these abstract concepts and skills.Primary school teachers default to applying general teaching strategies due to the lack of an age‐appropriate, specific activity sequencing model to use during coding instruction. What does this paper add: The study fills the existing gap by presenting a newly conceptualised instructional model, which considers the students' developmental stage of learning and pedagogical best practices.The study trialled the 3C Model with primary school students in a classroom setting.The study found that employing the pedagogical approach of the 3C Model increased students' engagement levels and resulted in enhanced curriculum learning outcomes. Implications for practitioners: Without an age‐appropriate instructional sequencing model students may not be grasping the underlying concepts.Simply focusing on the code without emphasising concepts such as decomposition and algorithmic thinking will result in shallow learning.Key considerations in using the 3C Model are ensuring that conceptual development occurs using physical computing devices and language students are familiar with prior to introducing coding language and its symbolic representations.Primary school teachers should consider incorporating physical interactive digital devices, physical movement, staged language development and subsequent coding procedures within the context of an engaging and authentic problem. This approach enables students to effectively grasp and represent coding and computational thinking concepts and skills, surpassing mere procedural and rote learning.

10.1007/s10798-024-09888-4,"The purpose of this study is to derive a correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the computational thinking ability of gifted students in Korea. The correlation between each element was analyzed by looking at the sub-elements of computational thinking according to the components of technological thinking disposition. The experiment was conducted from September 2019 to February 2021 with 217 students of I Gifted School in Incheon, South Korea. The collected data were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient using the statistical program R using Google COLAB. A summary of the study results is as follows. First, regarding the correlation between technological thinking ability, among the 6 components of technological thinking disposition, technological creativity and expression disposition and technological manipulation disposition show the highest correlation at 0.851. This shows that students who have an excellent ability to implement algorithms with new ideas or express them in various other attempts when implementing programs for gifted students also tend to enjoy program coding or have a tendency to like coding. Second, concerning the correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the sub-factors of computational thinking, some elements showed negative correlations and some had almost no correlation index. Students with high technological curiosity, however, tended to show a 0.287 in the parallelism factor compared to other factors. This showed a generally high trend. It can be said that students who want to know the functions, uses, forms, and characteristics of functions while implementing programs tend to have a better ability to divide large tasks into smaller tasks and process them simultaneously compared with other sub-elements of computational thinking. Third, regarding the correlation between computational thinking skills, the correlation between data analysis and pattern recognition was the highest at 0.637. This indicates that students who have an excellent ability to analyze a given coding problem also can find rules in data, showing that students at gifted schools in Korea tend to enjoy problem-solving.

Computational thinking is a relatively new term in early childhood education that refers to a specific problem-solving thinking process involving various logical and analytical thinking skills. Four foundational skills have been identified as core thinking skills of computational thinking: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithm. We explain these four skills in this paper and their practical applications to teaching and learning in early childhood education. Early computational thinking skills are found in common early childhood activities. This paper identifies activities teachers can use in the classroom to explicitly promote children's computational thinking and provides a new perspective on how to adapt classroom activities to integrate computational thinking. In particular, we emphasize the need to vary the demands of the content in the activity and incorporate computational thinking based on children's needs and development to ensure that children progress through the thinking process.

10.1111/bjet.13256,"An important educational goal for the next generation is the ability to think computationally. Cultivating K‐12 students' computational thinking (CT) requires the capacity building of teachers through teacher development programs. However, if students' learning outcomes were not assessed, it is not known whether the enhancement of teacher capacity could impact on students' learning. This study aimed to examine how a teacher development program changed teachers' content knowledge and collaborative engagement, which in turn influenced their students' learning achievement. The participants were 81 teachers and 3226 students from primary schools. We employed multi‐level modelling to study the relationships between teacher‐level variables and student achievement assessed by a CT concepts test. The teachers' content knowledge and collaborative engagement were significantly enhanced through the program, which in turn had a significant impact on student achievement. Teachers' years of teaching experience, but not their gender or whether they had majored in computer science, could also affect student achievement. The results indicate that a teacher development program can play a significant role in enhancing the teachers' CT content knowledge and collaborative engagement, which can then have a positive effect on student learning. Practitioner notes: What is already known about this topic The cultivation of students' computational thinking (CT) in K‐12 education requires the capacity building of teachers.A teacher development program can improve teachers' knowledge and attitudes related to CT.Whether the enhancement of teacher capacity can in turn affect students' learning achievement in CT is less studied. What this paper adds We found that a teacher development program could significantly enhance teachers' knowledge in CT and their collaborative engagement in the program.Using multilevel modelling, we found further that the enhancement of teachers' knowledge and collaborative engagement could affect students' understanding of CT concepts positively.Teachers' years of teaching experience, but not their gender or whether they had majored in computer science, could also influence student achievement. Implications for practice and/or policy In designing similar teacher development programs for teachers, collaborative engagement opportunities should be provided as it can have a positive impact on student achievement.Although the majority of teachers do not have a background in computer science, a teacher development program can play a significant role in enhancing their knowledge in CT, no matter they had majored in computer science or not.The significance of the program is not limited to the development of teachers, as the enhancements of teachers' knowledge and collaborative engagement through the program can in turn have a positive impact on students' understanding of CT concepts.

Reverse engineering pedagogy (REP) can improve students' CT due to its ability to develop students' cooperativity, algorithmic thinking, creativity, and problem-solving in discipline education. Thus, this study aimed to explore the effect of REP on primary school students' CT skills in STEM learning activities. A total of 101 fifth graders in a primary school participated in the study for one semester (16 weeks), including 51 students in the experimental group (EG) with REP, and 50 students in the control group (CG) with the demonstration method (DM). The computational thinking scale (CTS) was used to measure the CT skills of students in the pretest and posttest. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the data. The results verified that REP had a fine effect on the improvement of students' CT skills compared to the DM. The findings can provide some ideas for researchers to develop students' CT skills in STEM learning activities. Teachers can use different teaching methods to reasonably arrange teaching activities to develop primary school students' CT skills.

10.3390/info14020118,"Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as an umbrella term that refers to a broad set of problem-solving skills. New generations must conquer these skills in order to thrive in a computer-based world. Teachers, as agents of change, must also be familiar, trained and well-prepared in order to train children in CT. This paper examines STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and non-STEM teachers' attitudes and readiness to adopt and utilize Computational Thinking concepts in the curriculum. The research was conducted through a descriptive assessment of students using thematically related criteria (rubrics) and a criterion on Computational Thinking usage and utilization. Fifteen teachers (n = 15) were invited to a focus group discussion in which they were asked to complete a questionnaire and, subsequently, to openly analyze their answers. The results show that the majority of teachers used computational thinking as an assessment criterion and stated that they did not face any significant problems with it. At the end of the focus group questions, they concluded that they consider participation in a training program regarding the concept and principles of computational thinking and the way they could integrate into the educational process necessary.

10.1080/15391523.2024.2399257,"AbstractStudents in Appalachia have a heritage of problem-solving. We explore how computational thinking (CT) relates to and complements this heritage by analyzing 34 local ingenuity stories, and perspectives from 35 community members about the relevance of CT. We found the two problem-solving approaches are meaningfully different, but can be used in concert. Since equating them could contribute to confusion and cultural erasure, researchers and educators bringing CT as a problem solving strategy into rural and other resourceful cultures must clarify what they mean by “CT helps problem solving.” In these cultures, CT skills are better introduced as new tools to expand students’ problem-solving toolkits, rather than tools that are identical to or better than those traditionally used in their culture.

10.1007/s11423-023-10339-5,"Due to its task-based, gamified, and interactive features, unplugged programming activity has been widely employed in education and teaching as an activity away from electronic screens and other digital devices. There is ongoing debate over how to help K-9 pupils develop their computational thinking through unplugged programming activities. Based on findings from 15 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted domestically and abroad between 2006 and 2023, this study adopts meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the influence of unplugged programming activities on K-9 students' computational thinking, focusing on an in-depth analysis of variables such as different students' grade, gender, experimental period, research discipline, and unplugged programming activities categories. The results show that unplugged programming activity has a positive effect on the computational thinking of K-9 students (Hedges' g =.631, 95% CI.463,.799, P <.001), and its promotion effect is affected by the variables such as students' grade, learning time, subjects studied, and unplugged programming activities categories. Based on the conclusions of the meta-analysis, this paper proposes several suggestions. For example, it suggests paying attention to the cultivation of computational thinking among middle school students, and mastering the appropriate timing for unplugged programming activities to avoid the plateau effect. Additionally, it recommends strengthening the integration of unplugged programming activities across different disciplines, as well as promoting the use of storytelling and collaborative unplugged programming activities in the classroom.

10.1007/s10956-023-10089-2,"In the early years, it has become essential to support the acquisition of computational thinking, which is seen as a 21st-century skill and new literacy. A valid and reliable measurement tool is needed to develop and evaluate educational practices related to these skills. TechCheck is a validated unplugged assessment of computational thinking skills for young children. (Relkin & Bers in IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) in 2021 (pp. 1696–1702), 2021; Relkin et al. in Journal of Science Education and Technology 29(4):482–498, 2020). This study aims to adapt and characterize a Turkish version of TechCheck-K for children aged 5–6. Validity and reliability of the Turkish version were established through classical test theory and item response theory, as had been done for the original English language version. Based on classical test theory, the confirmatory factor analysis used A tetrachoric weighted matrix to test the instrument's structure. The one-dimensional structure of the instrument was verified. The KR-20 reliability coefficient for the scale consisting of one dimension and 15 items was.87, which is considered an acceptable level of reliability. Rasch and 2PL models were compared with M2 statistics to determine the item and test parameters based on item response theory (IRT). The 2PL model was chosen as the best fit. Mean TechCheck scores differed based on gender, socio-economic status, past exposure to computers, and coding experience. These results indicate that the Turkish version of TechCheck-K has acceptable psychometric properties for measuring computational thinking skills in children between 5 and 6 years of age.

10.1007/s11423-023-10328-8,"In the current era where computational literacy holds significant relevance, a growing number of schools across the globe have placed emphasis on K-12 programming education. This field of education primarily comprises two distinct modalities—the block-based programming modality (BPM) and the text-based programming modality (TPM). Previous research may not have provided a complete understanding of the differences between these two modalities as it did not take into account both the learning process and learning outcomes. This study aimed to compare secondary students' programming behaviors, computational thinking skills, and attitudes toward programming between the two modalities through a quasi-experimental design in a Chinese secondary school. The findings showed that (1) learners in TPM encountered more syntactical errors and spent more time between two clicks of debugging, while learners in BPM had more code-changing behaviors by adjusting programming blocks, made more attempts of debugging, and had more irrelevant behaviors; (2) learners in BPM achieved a higher level of computational thinking skills; (3) learners in both modalities experienced a slight decrease in confidence and enjoyment, while learners in BPM had higher interest levels in programming. (4) Code Changer, Minimal Debugger, Maximal Debugger, Distracted Coder and Average Coder were identified through students' programming behavior in the two programming modalities, and differences in their CT skills and attitudinal data were revealed. Lastly, pedagogical implications based on the findings are also discussed.

10.1111/jcal.12921,"Background: Despite its obvious relevance to computer science, computational thinking (CT) is transdisciplinary with the potential of impacting one's analytical ability. Although countless efforts have been invested across K‐12 education, there is a paucity of research at the postsecondary level about the extent to which CT can contribute to sustainable learning outcomes. Objectives: The current study examines how a series of Arduino‐based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT. Methods: College students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think‐alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments. Results and Conclusions: Students verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging. Students exposed to active learning performed better in a virtual robotics challenge compared to their peers in a traditional‐oriented classroom. Students' scores on the physical robotics challenge increased as a function of the number of references they made to CT concepts during the think‐alouds. It is possible to design pedagogical experiences that tap into various dimensions of CT at incremental levels of complexity through a series of Arduino‐based robotics activities. With the integration of an online simulation, students can visualize and transfer their CT skills between a virtual and physical learning environment, thus leading to more sustainable learning outcomes. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) is the conceptual foundation for problem‐solving.CT shifted from unplugged to plugged activities.CT concepts can be fostered through educational robotics. What this paper adds: A multi‐dimensional approach to assessing CT.Applications of CT provide insights into skill transfer.An integrative theoretical approach to study the 'how' and the 'what' of CT. Implications for practice: Educational robotics activities can cater to a fuller range of CT skills.Virtual simulations with constructive feedback are beneficial for students in traditional settings.Mixed learning environments contribute to making links between lectures and labs.

10.1111/jcal.12900,"Background: Computational thinking (CT) has been broadly considered one of the 21st‐century competencies, and an emerging trend has been seen in integrating CT into primary education. Cumulative research was conducted to investigate the influencing factors of CT learning performance, and an ample range of factors has been identified, involving both cognitive and non‐cognitive facets. However, limited has been done in exploring the non‐cognitive factors, and even less at the primary education level. Objective: To address this gap, this study bridged CT with personality in the primary school context, and more importantly, it proposed a mediator in the personality‐CT relationship that is, attitudinal beliefs, which are amenable to change, thereby allowing further support for nurturing the traits. Method: Based on the Big Five model of personality, standard tests were administered to a sample of 434 primary school students (ages 8–11), and data were analysed using structural equation modelling via Mplus. To improve the robustness of the results, control variables (i.e., demographic features, coding experience) were added to the research model, and a bootstrap approach with 5000 resamples was used to examine the mediating effect. Result and Conclusion: Findings demonstrated that Conscientiousness had a positive effect on CT, and attitudinal beliefs mediated the effect of Open‐mindedness (positive) and Negative Emotionality (negative) on CT. The study contributes to the literature by enriching the CT network with non‐intellectual components and unravelling the mechanism of CT regarding how disposition traits turn into learning performance. The results implicate practitioners on the importance of encouraging conscientious behaviours and nurturing positive attitudinal beliefs in CT primary education. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Personality traits can play a role in students' learning performance.The relationship between personality and computational thinking (CT) has been verified in teenage cohorts.Simply studying personalities may have limited practical implications, as these traits tend to be stable features that practitioners have little control over. What this paper adds: This is the first study investigating the effect of personalities on CT performance at the primary education level.The study examined the association between conscientiousness and CT performance.This is the first study revealing the underlying mechanism of the personality‐CT relationship.The study identified the mediating role of attitudinal beliefs in the personality‐CT relationship. The implications of study findings for practitioners: The study enriched the nomological network of CT in the primary context with essential non‐cognitive components.The study unravelled the underlying mechanism of the personality‐CT relationship, helping explain how personality traits turn into learning performance.The study indicated the importance of encouraging conscientious behaviours and nurturing positive attitudinal beliefs in CT primary education.

10.5753/rbie.2023.3330,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for everyone to fully experience in today's technological society. CT can be promoted from early literacy through plug-in or unplugged approaches. Educational digital games (EDG) are a dynamic and attractive possibility to promote CT, especially for children. The intellectual skills promoted by the CT, together with the EDG, can help people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) to improve cognitive deficits, as long as the games have accessibility features to meet this audience's specific needs of interaction. This article presents the construction process of an accessible EDG that aims to promote the development of CT for neurotypical and ID children who are at the beginning of the literacy process. This game was titled 'Pensar e Lavar', as its narrative is the process of washing clothes, in which the pillars of the CT are intrinsically worked on in each phase. Its development process was based on accessibility guidelines, identified by systematic research, and supported by specialists in Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and People with Disabilities. The game underwent four evaluation stages, including evaluating with target audience, in which 47 neurotypical and ID children participated.

10.5753/rbie.2023.2866,"The number of Computational Thinking (CT) initiatives in schools is increasing in several countries. However, Brazil still lacks actions that implement such practice. In the country, a National Common Core Curriculum (BNCC) was created to ensure the right to learn a fundamental set of common knowledge and skills. The document defines the main guidelines for K-12 education, aiming to promote the development of students equally. Among the skills are computer programming and English, which can be an alternative for the practice of CT. This work presents a didactic sequence of programming classes using Scratch in English for Elementary School students, applying the Content-Based Second Language Teaching methodology together with elements of Creative Learning. This experimental design was rescued from the lesson plans of 2018, which were restructured and reclassified according to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy, for the proposition of a didactic sequence. From it and its restructuring, it was possible to analyze the evolution of the hierarchical levels of cognitive domain and the complexity of the developed projects, as well as to show that it is possible to practice a second language or any other content while learning programming. It was also possible to experiment with a free project, with fourth-grade students, using Scratch from the perspective of Creative Learning. In this pilot experiment, it was observed that when students have the opportunity to do something of their own interest, with passion and in a team, they become more engaged in creating the project and achieve different levels of creative learning, sometimes even higher than they would develop in a project predefined by the teacher.

Although CT education has been investigated for many years, less attention has been paid to lower primary schools in rural areas. This study contributes to filling this gap by investigating the impact of three different learning approaches on the CT of grade-two primary school students in a rural area in China. Seventy-seven students were randomly assigned to three learning approaches, namely traditional lectures, Game-Based Learning (GBL) using a newly designed board game in classrooms, and GBL with parental involvement. The findings showed that both GBL approaches (i.e., with and without parents) significantly enhanced the students' CT skills compared to the traditional approach. The findings also showed that the GBL approach with parental involvement significantly enhanced students' attitudes toward learning CT compared with the other two approaches.

Findings show that think‐aloud interviews (1) are typically conducted in Computer Science classrooms and with K‐12 students; (2) are usually combined with other exploratory CT assessment tools; (3) have the potential to benefit learners with special needs and identify the competency gaps through involving diverse participants; (4) are conducted in the absence of cognitive models and standard procedures; and (5) display insufficient definitional and methodological rigor.

Practically, this review serves as a reference for studying the cognitive processes during CT problem‐solving and provides suggestions for CT researchers who intend to incorporate think‐aloud interviews in their studies.

10.1111/ejed.12640,"Computational Thinking (CT) is crucial for the advancement of the STEM field, where there continues to be a lack of female representation. Teaching and learning (T/L) of CT should incorporate didactic strategies that aim to eliminate gender biases and integrate girls/women into this context. In response to the question, ""What didactic strategies have been implemented in the T/L of CT in primary and secondary education?"". A systematic review was conducted following a PRISMA protocol specifically designed for this review. The study analysed Didactic Strategies (DS) and examined whether they incorporated the so‐called ""minimum actions"" (MA) proposed in this article as a strategy to integrate females into CT. The findings revealed a limited number of studies that implemented these actions. In conclusion, there is an urgent need to continue developing DS that incorporate these MA to effectively integrate girls and women into CT, allowing them to play a central role in its advancement and development.

10.1080/10494820.2024.2349883,"Computational thinking (CT), acknowledged as a crucial twenty-first century skill, has attracted considerable attention. However, cultivating CT in resource-limited rural schools is challenging, with limited research on its development in these settings. Unplugged programming, not constrained by the availability of computer hardware, may offer a promising approach to fostering CT skills within rural schools. This study conducted a six-week quasi-experimental project in a rural school in Guizhou, China. In this study, 43 students participated in unplugged activities in the experimental group, while 45 students in the control group did not engage in any form of programming activities. The findings are noteworthy: post-intervention, the experimental group showed notable improvements in CT skills and resilience, unlike the control group. Additionally, the study explored gender differences, revealing that students of all genders exhibited similar growth in CT skills and resilience through unplugged activities. Resilience was identified as a key factor in enhancing CT skills. Interviews further enriched the quantitative findings. This research provides valuable insights for educators to improve rural education and promote CT education.

10.1002/sce.21850,"Science educators are integrating more and more computational thinking (CT) activities into their curricula. Proponents of CT offer two motivations: familiarizing students with a realistic depiction of the computational nature of modern scientific practices and encouraging more students from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, some studies show that increasing exposure to computing may not necessarily translate to the hypothesized gains in participation by female students and students of color. Therefore, paying close attention to students' engagement in computationally intense science activities is important to finding more impactful ways to promote equitable science education. In this paper, we present an in‐depth analysis of the interactions among a small, racially diverse group of high school students during a chemistry unit with tightly integrated CT activities. We find a salient interaction between the students' engagement with the CT activities and their social identification with publicly recognizable categories such as ""enjoys coding"" or ""finds computing boring."" We show that CT activities in science education can lead to numerous rich interactions that could, if leveraged correctly, allow educators to facilitate more inclusive science classrooms. However, we also show that such opportunities would be missed unless teachers are attentive to them. We discuss the implications of our findings on future work to integrate CT across science curricula and teacher education.

10.1177/02103702241253407,"Fostering young children's computational thinking (CT) has garnered global interest as it aligns with the cultivation of twenty-first-century skills. Previous studies have focused on physical, virtual and hybrid kits with virtual programming blocks, but rarely explored the use of hybrid kits that combine virtual sprites and physical programming environments. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to investigate the effect of using a hybrid programming kit on young children's CT. Furthermore, we explored the characteristics of children's programming engagement and the instructional strategies employed by teachers through video analysis and interviews. The results showed that: (1) children's CT in the experimental group significantly improved, compared to that of peers in the control group; (2) children's programming behaviour demonstrated a change from 'action preceding thought' to 'thought preceding action' and from 'relying on trial and error' to 'active debugging' with the support of teachers; (3) teachers used multiple strategies to support young children's programming. These findings further indicate the importance of introducing programming in early childhood education and emphasize the critical role that teachers play in supporting young children's learning of programming.

10.1080/13540602.2024.2313635,"Owing to its recognition as a 21st-century skill, computational thinking (CT) is currently being introduced into school curricula around the world. However, in-service teachers are largely unprepared for this implementation, which, in turn, makes teacher educators (TEds) important stakeholders in preparing prospective teachers to integrate CT into their classroom practices. In this regard, TEds are charged with a twofold responsibility: they must develop not only their own CT skills and digital competence but also a way of teaching these to the next generation of teachers who will facilitate future pupils' learning. In this paper, we report on 17 TEds' experience regarding the challenges and opportunities of integrating CT into Norway's primary teacher education mathematics and science courses two years after CT's introduction into Norwegian primary schools. A data-driven thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews was conducted. Our analysis suggests that it is challenging to integrate CT into existing courses. Such challenges, as well as opportunities, seem to apply at four levels: the systemic, teacher educator, student teacher, and subject levels. The results provide valuable insights for key stakeholders into the challenges and opportunities of integrating CT into teacher education, thus contributing to the body of research on professional digital competence.

10.1007/s11423-023-10312-2,"This study investigated the effects of the single programming approach (plugged-in and unplugged) and the mixed programming approach (plugged-in-first and unplugged-first) on the computational thinking (CT) skills of first-grade students. However, focusing only on the programming learning approach itself is insufficient. Therefore, the influences of students' gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence factors on CT skills were also examined. 121 students from China were divided into four experimental and one control groups and engaged in the programming activities intervention for 10 weeks. The data consisted mainly of students' CT skill scores before and after the programming activities intervention. The results showed that both single and mixed programming approaches significantly improved students' CT skills, with the mixed programming approaches being more effective. Furthermore, the study found that the implementation of unplugged activities in the first stage attenuated the effects of programming experience. Furthermore, it was found that the unplugged-first programming approach was able to diminish the effect of students' programming experience on the development of CT skills and could be an essential condition to promote the development of equal CT skills. We also clarified the important role of programming interest and programming confidence in students' CT development. More importantly, a chain mediation effect of programming experience and programming interest between programming confidence and CT was also found. Finally, this study further discusses ideas and approaches for the future of CT education for primary school students and provides certain practical suggestions and insights for teachers and researchers.

Technology is present from children to older people, helping in the most diverse daily tasks and allowing accessibility. However, many times these people are just end-users, without any incentive to develop computational thinking (CT). With advances in technologies, the abstraction of coding, programming languages, and the hardware resources involved will become a reality. However, while we have not progressed to this stage, it is necessary to encourage the development of CT teaching from an early age. This work will present the state of the art concerning teaching initiatives and tools on programming, robotics, and other playful tools for the development of CT in the early ages, explicitly filling the gap of CT at the kindergarten level. We present a systematic literature review evaluating more than 60 papers from 2010 to December 2020. The paper's amount was classified in taxonomy to show CT's principal tools and initiates applied to children early.

10.1111/bjet.13215,"Programmable robotics is recently used in early childhood education (ECE) to introduce programming and computational thinking (CT) skills. However, there is a further need for research to contrast the efficacy of children's participation in robot programming and traditionally beneficial ECE activities. The present study thus investigated the effects of a robot programming intervention versus a block play program on kindergarteners' CT, sequencing ability, and self‐regulation. The experiment (robot programming) versus comparison (block play) condition was randomly assigned to four kindergarten classes, which included 101 kindergarteners (M = 64.78 months, SD = 7.64). Statistical analyses revealed that the robot programming group (N = 54) had experienced greater gains over time in sequencing ability relative to those in the block play group (N = 47; F = 5.09, p < 0.05). Children in the robot programming group with lower level of self‐regulation at baseline showed larger improvements in sequencing ability over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.37, p = 0.01). Also, children in the robot programming group with older age showed larger improvements in CT over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.40, p < 0.01). The study demonstrates the positive benefits of robot programming to early childhood development in terms of CT and sequencing ability, compared to a traditional curriculum activity in ECE—block play. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Screen‐free robot programming can enhance preschool children's computational thinking (CT).Block play can enhance preschool children's mathematics and executive functioning.Both robot programming and block play are engaging for preschool children.What this paper adds An unplugged CT assessment is used to measure and compare the effects of both robot programming and block play interventions among preschool children.Robot programming outperforms block play in promoting children's school readiness skills such as sequencing ability.Children with lower self‐regulation skills benefited more from the robot programming intervention.Implications for practice and/or policy Robot programming and CT education should be expanded in diverse early childhood settings to boost the positive effects.Technology‐enhanced curricula should be integrated into early childhood education.Teachers should receive training on robot programming in addition to more traditional skills such as scaffolding children's block play.

This Innovation to Practice article describes how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher educators can use MEAs to build elementary teachers' understanding of computational thinking (CT). Our Countdown Timer MEA is aligned with Grade 2 mathematics and computer science standards. We discuss how this MEA created opportunities for teachers in an online graduate STEM education course to engage as learners in unplugged and plugged CT activities. Teachers used algorithmic design and debugging to model a digital display and to create block‐based code for a recess countdown timer. Teachers' reflections on how their learning experiences were different than those offered in step‐by‐step CT lessons allowed teachers to envision how MEAs can promote important CT dispositions of persistence in open‐ended problem solving and tolerance for ambiguity. By aligning MEA design and facilitation with the phases of the engineering design process, teacher educators can use modeling to engage elementary teachers in facets of CT that are transferable to the elementary STEM classroom.

10.1007/s11423-022-10145-5,"Prior studies on game-based learning provide limited and mixed results in the transfer of skills learned during game play to contexts outside of the game. This study tested the effects of playing a blocked-based programming educational game implemented with in-game cognitive supports on students' ability to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) skills in near and far transfer tasks. With 79 students randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the control group received basic game supports and the treatment group received cognitive supports in addition to the basic game supports. After two hours of total gameplay over the course of four days, both groups performed equally well, and students' CT skills were improved significantly at the near transfer level but not at the far transfer level. Students in the control condition performed significantly better on far transfer compared to the students in the treatment condition. Regression analyses indicated that the overall use of the cognitive supports was infrequent, but the amount of time spent voluntarily using cognitive supports with help on goal setting and worked examples predicted far transfer performance. How students use the cognitive supports (subverting the use of cognitive support to conscientiously learn the computational skill by using them more as game cheat sheets) might explain these findings. Design implications and directions for future research on facilitating learning transfer with in-game supports are discussed.

One of the intentions is to take advantage of the skills that exist in haptic interaction to achieve a certain objective, including teaching and learning. This article proposes the construction of a tangible interface to be used in robot programming, using concepts such as computional thinking (CT) and Bloom's taxonomy as theoretical bases for teaching and learning. The user interacts with the interface through blocks, each of which has a specific function (front, right, left, back, loop and if). With the blocks properly positioned on a platform, in their execution order, the robot can execute the planned movement. The interface validation was performed with 10 elementary school students, aged eight to nine years. In the result, it was possible to observe a good evaluation for usability, in addition to the application of the concepts of bloom taxonomy. Quantitatively, it was not possible to observe a significant difference in the averages of the tests on the CT (pre and post tests), despite the descriptive statistical measures showing a higher concentration of correct answers in the tests after the experiment. Qualitatively, the experiments showed the use of CT concepts such as abstraction, generalization, logical analysis, evaluation and the very concept of algorithm.

10.3233/JID-220009,"The design of real-world industrial systems is subject to a natural tendency towards modularization in order to manage complexity. In addition, this article considers that patterns of self-similarity in many problem domains have made many such solutions naturally representable as holarchies. Likewise, the increasing need for autonomous local decision making as well as the demand to produce solutions at scale has increased the relevance of the multi-agent paradigm to the creation of modern software systems. A variety of software development patterns are explored for their compatibility with holonic multi-agency. The current skill sets required by software development workers and concomitant training activities focus on instilling computational thinking abilities, a set of related cognitive competencies useful in the development of such systems. Intelligent systems play an increasingly important role in modern development and often benefit from computational intelligence techniques for the purpose of parameter tuning. This position paper explores the intersections between holonic multi-agency, modern information systems development, the computational intelligence which train them and the computational thinking skills those developers should be trained in.

The sample group consisted of 532 primary school teachers and 33 first-grade students in Thailand. The study demonstrated that a causal model was consistent with the empirical data (Chi-square = 216.06, df = 262, p = 0.000, GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.95, RMR = 0.018, RMSEA = 0.000). The result found that “Facilitating Conditions’ have a positive effect on “Perceived Usefulness’ (β = 0.19), “Subjective Norm Conformance” influences “Perceived Usefulness’ (β = 0.49), “Perceived Ease of Use” influences “Perceived Usefulness’ (β = 0.26), “Perceived Usefulness’ influenced “Attitudes Toward Technology” (β = 0.12), “Attitudes Toward Technology” influenced “Behavioral Intention” (β = 0.88), and “The Facilitating Conditions’ had an inverse effect on “Behavioral Intention” (β = −0.16). Moreover, teaching assistant robots for primary school students were developed, which consist of: (1) characteristics and components of teaching assistant robots, namely the central processing unit, driving system, wheels, recognition part, display and sound section, power supply, etc. and (2) seven scenario-based learning activities designed to guide teachers, instructors, and educators to effectively implement a robot aimed at improving young students’ computational thinking abilities.

10.1111/bjet.13358,"Collaborative programming helps improve students' computational thinking and increases their confidence in solving programming problems. However, the effect of collaborative learning is not ideal because it is difficult for students to mobilize metacognition to regulate learning spontaneously. To guide students to effectively regulate the learning process when they collaborate to solve programming problems, this study develops a collaborative learning approach and a Collaborative programming System (MR‐CPS) based on metacognitive regulation to support students' collaborative programming learning. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted in a junior high school programming course in Taiwan to assess the effects on students. The impacts of MR‐CPS from both individual and collaborative perspectives were investigated. Students' learning achievement and computational thinking tendencies were examined from an individual perspective. From a collaborative perspective, group self‐efficacy and group metacognition were investigated. Participants were divided into MR‐CPS (n = 115) and No‐MR‐CPS (n = 107). The MR‐CPS group used the collaborative programming approach with metacognitive regulation mechanisms as the experimental group. In contrast, the No‐MR‐CPS group used the collaborative programming approach without metacognitive regulation mechanisms as the control group. The results show that the MR‐CPS group statistically significantly outperformed the No‐MR‐CPS group in learning achievements. It was also found that the MR‐CPS group had statistically significantly better computational thinking tendency, collective efficacy and metacognitive planning and evaluation skills than the No‐MR‐CPS group. This finding suggests that the MR‐CPS has the potential to improve students' learning achievements, computational thinking tendency, group metacognition and collective efficacy. The study results have implications for the design of collaborative programming systems consistent with metacognitive regulation.

10.22550/2174-0909.3933,"The development of computational thinking has become one of the educational priorities in several countries around the world. In this article, two experiences are described in which two block programming tools are used. The first experience only used BlocksCAD, while the second added the use of Blockly and the work on some mathematical algorithms in a maths classroom. The number of participants in the experience was twenty-eight in the group that only used Blocky and thirteen in the group that combined the use of both tools, all of them of the third year of secondary education (between 14 and 15 years old) in a school in Spain. The results show that, although the use of Blocks-CAD alone allows an increase in the development of CT, if other resources such as Blockly are also used in the mathematics classroom, the effect is multiplied. In addition, considering the satisfaction results of the participants in the experience, together with the possibility of printing their own creations through 3D modelling (a fact claimed by the students themselves), this encourages us to continue using both tools and even to try to combine them with other tools and to design experiences that encompass entire academic courses or, at least, entire trimesters.

En este artículo, se describen dos experiencias en el aula en las que se utilizan dos herramientas de programación por bloques. En la primera, solo se empleó BlocksCAD. En la segunda, se trabajó, además, con Blockly y con varios algoritmos matemáticos. El número de participantes en la experiencia fue de veintiocho en el grupo que solo utilizó Blockly y de trece en el que combinó el uso de ambas herramientas. Todos ellos cursaban tercero de educación secundaria (entre 14 y 15 años) en un colegio de España. Los resultados muestran que, si bien el uso de BlocksCAD ha permitido, por sí solo, incrementar el desarrollo del PC, la combinación con otros recursos como Blockly en el aula de matemáticas puede multiplicar su efecto. Además, los participantes expresaron su satisfacción con la experiencia. Como propuesta de futuro, se plantea la posibilidad de que el alumnado pueda imprimir sus propias creaciones mediante modelado 3D, algo que ellos mismos pidieron. Esto nos animaría a seguir utilizando ambas herramientas e, incluso, a intentar combinarlas con otras y diseñar experiencias que abarquen cursos académicos o, al menos, trimestres completos.

10.1007/s10798-021-09679-1,"The inclusion of Computational Thinking (CT) in the classroom along with the promotion of positive attitudes in early ages towards technology have great relevance in the current educational paradigm. This study analyses whether CT instruction may improve pupils' attitudes towards technology, and also considers whether instructional approaches and gender are influencing factors. The study was conducted with 84 second graders using a quasi-experimental design. The students' attitudes towards technology were measured before and after the intervention using the Pupils' Attitudes Toward Technology test. The results indicate that CT instruction improves children's attitudes towards technology and narrows the gender gap, regardless of the approach. The inclusion of formal activities for CT can have beneficial effects beyond this learning. The reduction of the gender gap in technology at these ages is a fundamental issue for the promotion of scientific vocations among girls.

Different from child–robot interactions as investigated in the social robot field, student–robot (S–R) interactions focus mainly on the process of interaction between learners and programmable robot kits in RE settings. At a four-week robotics summer camp in China, mixed-methods research was conducted. Forty primary school students and one dedicated robotics teacher participated in this research, while 32 students and the teacher completed all the lessons and data collection procedures of the summer camp. Results indicated that students' CT skill increased during the summer camp and that the change in their CT skill was positively correlated to the time spent on S–R interaction. Additionally, how three kinds of S–R interaction—programming-computing, observational investigation, and participatory investigation—cultivated students' CT were found. Moreover, the hierarchy of three S–R interactions and students' role-shifting in the hierarchy were discussed. Previous studies rarely discussed S–R interaction; however, this kind of interaction should be explored because it provides more information about students' natural learning process, which might be meaningful to RE practice.

10.1080/00368121.2022.2071817,"STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.

10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0009,"TechCheck is an assessment of Computational Thinking (CT) for early elementary school children consisting of fifteen developmentally appropriate unplugged challenges that probe six CT domains. The first version of TechCheck showed good psychometric properties as well as ease of administration and scoring in a validation cohort of 768 children between 5 and 9 years of age. To increase sensitivity and reduce possible ceiling and floor effects, grade-specific versions of TechCheck (K, 1, 2) were subsequently created. In the present study, we explored how CT skills could be compared across grades when grade-specific versions of TechCheck are administered. First, we examined TechCheck raw score distributions and responses within CT domains in a representative sample of students from the three grades. Grade-specific Z-scores and percentile rankings were then calculated. To show utility of this normalization system, we used percentiles to compare CT outcomes between first and second graders who participated in a ScratchJr coding educational intervention. While TechCheck change scores suggested an unexpected 42.74% difference in CT outcomes between first and second grade, application of the normative scoring system indicated a more plausible 5.17 percentile rank difference between grades. Normative analysis may provide a more meaningful way to compare results across grades when grade-specific versions of TechCheck are used. Implications for the future use of the TechCheck CT assessments are discussed.

10.3390/s22103746,"In the context of the science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics disciplines in education, subjects tend to use contextualized activities or projects. Educational robotics and computational thinking both have the potential to become subjects in their own right, though not all educational programs yet offer these. Despite the use of technology and programming platforms being widespread, it is not common practice to integrate computational thinking and educational robotics into the official curriculum in secondary education. That is why this paper continues an initial project of integrating computational thinking and educational robotics into a secondary school in Barcelona, Spain. This study presents a project-based learning approach where the main focus is the development of skills related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics and the acquisition of computational thinking knowledge in the second year of pupils' studies using a block-based programming environment. The study develops several sessions in the context of project-based learning, with students using the block-programming platform ScratchTM. During these sessions and in small-group workshops, students will expand their knowledge of computational thinking and develop 21st-century skills. We demonstrate the superior improvement of these concepts and skills compared to other educational methodologies.

Virtual Pivot employed research-based design principles for virtual teacher PD, including asynchronous and synchronous engagement, explicit instruction in technological tools and scaffolds for teacher collaboration. Data sources included pre-PD surveys (n = 151), post-PD surveys (n = 119), interviews (n = 57) and six-month follow-up surveys (n = 105). Findings describe elements of Virtual Pivot which supported teacher learning and engagement (virtual community of practice, PD structure, during-PD support, pre-PD support and badges).

10.1111/bjet.13175,"The participatory view of learning emphasises students' identity construction. However, identity research in the context of programming education to cultivate students' computational thinking is scarce. In this study, an instrument of computational identity with components of engagement, imagination and affiliation, was developed and validated. Convenience sampling was used to select 1066 senior primary school students studying programming to respond to the instrument, and to a programming empowerment instrument developed previously with components of meaningfulness, self‐efficacy and impact. The two instruments' factor structure was confirmed to have acceptable discriminant validity and support gender invariance. There was a positive relationship between programming empowerment and computational identity. Specifically, students' perceived meaningfulness and self‐efficacy of programming related to all aspects of computational identity. The perceived impact of programming is related only to the imaginative aspect of computational identity. The establishment of the instrument enables researchers to investigate further factors related to students' computational identity development. The results also indicate that the programming curriculum should be carefully designed so that students can realise the meaning of the activities and foster their programming self‐efficacy. This, in turn, is critical to enable these primary school students to participate in and become a member of the digital community. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Cultivating students' computational thinking (CT) has become an educational goal in various countries around the world.It is necessary to develop appropriate tools to assess students' CT development.Founded on a participatory view of learning, identity has been employed in different subject areas to assess students' development, but identity research in CT is scarce.What this paper adds An instrument of computational identity with components of engagement, imagination and affiliation is developed and validated with a sample of senior primary students.This study shows the importance of empowerment in developing primary students' computational identity.Students' perceived meaningfulness of programming and self‐efficacy relate to all aspects of identity, but the impact of programming only relates to the imaginative aspect of identity.Implications for practice and/or policy The curriculum for CT should be designed carefully to foster the development of students' computational identity.The curriculum should allow students to see the meaning of programming activities and how young people can make an impact by means of CT.The programming tasks should be designed at an optimal level of difficulty so that students' self‐efficacy can be fostered.

However, the design of the educational robotic arm kit and the study on the effect of robotic arms on students' thinking literacy remain to be completed. In this paper, iArm, a 6-DOF robotic arm consisting of a drive chassis, an arm body, and end tools, is presented. Its auxiliary modules, including the vision module and conveyor belt, and the curriculum targeting students' computational thinking are also developed to refine the current educational robotic arm kit. Furthermore, to explore the effectiveness of the iArm kit, thirteen high school students participated in the semester-long curriculum, completed assigned projects, and filled out the pre-test and post-test scales. By formative and summative evaluation, the result shows that the iArm kit effectively enhanced students' computational thinking.

10.1080/10494820.2024.2331148,"Logistic regression models have traditionally been used to identify the factors contributing to students’ conceptual understanding. With the advancement of the machine learning-based research approach, there are reports that some machine learning algorithms outperform logistic regression models in terms of prediction. In this study, we collected cognitive, affective, and demographic data from 4,142 primary students as features to predict their understanding of computational thinking (CT) concepts. We identified and used five popularly used machine learning models. All five machine learning models outperformed the logistic regression model, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model achieving the highest predictive accuracy. We used these features and the K-means algorithm of the unsupervised clustering technique to identify four optimal clusters of students. By comparing the representative students from each of the four clusters, selected by the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding algorithm, we found that each cluster had its characteristics. For example, one cluster consisted of students who outperformed students in the other three clusters in mathematics, scored highest in prior experience in programming, and used computers and the Internet most frequently. By identifying the characteristics of these clusters, pedagogical design, and resource support can be proposed to support students’ learning of CT concepts.

Through a Narrative Literature Review (NLR), pivotal strategies for effective implementation are identified. These include fostering collaborative pedagogy, employing visualization tools, embracing diverse inquiry approaches, providing scaffolding, integrating local materials, and incorporating framework elements. The findings highlight the significance of comprehensive frameworks and underscore areas for further research to enrich teaching practices. By adapting the PRISMA framework and reviewing relevant articles from 2017 to 2022, this study offers valuable insights for educators aiming to integrate PBL-CT successfully into their teaching methodologies. It emphasizes the need for constructivist and collaborative approaches to learning, along with the utilization of visualization tools to aid comprehension. Moreover, diverse inquiry approaches coupled with scaffolding techniques are crucial for effective learning outcomes. Integrating local materials and embracing framework elements further enhance the integration of PBL and CT. However, the study suggests that a more comprehensive framework addressing various aspects of PBL-CT integration remains underexplored, indicating a potential avenue for future research to enrich educational practices.

This article examines a number of MBG to identify those that contain CT-promoting mechanics. We focus on MBG whose mechanics can implicitly support the development of CT, considering these games as valuable pedagogical tools for use in the classroom. Specifically, they can be used by groups of students to introduce, discuss and practice CT concepts. The research identifies several games considered ideal for achieving the aims of the PhD study. This article essentially explores the mechanics of carefully selected MBG, reflecting on how they integrate, support or relate to the development of CT, and discusses their implementation in educational contexts. The results suggest a practical approach to the selection of CT-promoting MBG, offering valuable insight for teachers and education professionals interested in using board games in education. The results point to the potential of these games as effective resources for developing CT in primary school students, contributing to both academic research and practical applications in education.

Its aim is to analyze the impact of robotics and programming on the motivation and involvement of students in the development of computational thinking, in the learning of mathematical concepts. The study was conducted with 36 elementary school students, where two game-based activities were designed and applied by using different technological tools (mBot and micro:bit). Data were collected from the participants using qualitative instruments, such as participant observation and semi-structured interviews. The data treatment technique selected was content analysis. The results establish evidence that the practice of these activities enabled students to learn while having fun and constructing knowledge from previous knowledge, consolidating contents. The dialogues and interviews with the students allowed us to identify that the educational use of robots encourages students' participation. The results revealed it remains central to wager on initial and continuing teacher training to transfer this knowledge into their pedagogical practices, promoting meaningful learning.

10.1080/03004430.2023.2299405,"This study investigated the development of computational thinking (CT) in young children within the specific context of Hong Kong. The researchers utilized an unplugged digital arts activity to explore the CT knowledge exhibited by children and document their developmental trajectories. A sample of 23 children aged 3 to 6 years participated in an animation art workshop conducted in a Hong Kong kindergarten. The video data were recorded and analyzed in terms of content. Drawing on a three-dimensional framework combining powerful ideas for teaching coding, the observations and field notes revealed that children's CT knowledge construction aligned with the CT conceptual framework. Notably, older children demonstrated more advanced competences and more complex cognitive structures in terms of the design process, representation, algorithms, modularity, sequences, connecting, choices of conduct, and utilization of hardware/software. These findings emphasize the importance of designing age-appropriate curricula that foster children's CT skills through the animation art.

10.1111/jcal.12940,"Background Objective Method Results and Conclusion Conclusion Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical component of 21st‐century skills, and increasing effort was seen in exploring the development of CT skills in K–12 students. Despite cumulative research on exploring students' CT acquisition and its influencing factors, learners' development of the skill over time and the underlying mechanism that contributes to individual differences remain unclear.To bridge this gap, the present study aimed to explore the individual differences in CT acquisition among primary school students and how these differences were shaped over time. Specifically, variations in the development of CT across demographics, including gender and learning experience, were explored.Three waves of data were collected from a sample of 322 primary school students (aged 7–12) across 18 months, with a 9‐month interval between adjacent waves. A time‐lagged model was leveraged for data analysis, and control variables were included in the model to strengthen statistical robustness.The results indicate that male students and those who were more experienced in coding tended to have more positive attitudes toward coding. Additionally, coding interest was found to mediate the relationship between demographics and CT, demonstrating that male students and more experienced learners tended to be more interested in coding, which, in turn, contributed to the development of CT skills in later stages.The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in CT development over time. The findings highlight the importance of nurturing coding interest among female students and promoting coding exposure for novice learners.

10.1080/07380569.2023.2206825,"There is substantial evidence that incorporating interactive environments for game-based instruction has a significant potential to support the development of computational thinking and programming skills in primary education students. However, it is not clear whether a simulation game (SG) with different user interface elements, created via three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds and visual programming environments to project various problem-solving exercises in a simulated reality, can significantly influence students to think and practice ""computationally"" their solution plans into code. The current study aims to identify any possible added value of each instructional approach by measuring students' game experience and learning performance. This quasi-experimental study involved ninety participants (n = 90) aged between 10 and 11 years that consisted of two comparison conditions. The experimental group (n = 45) received training using OpenSimulator in combination with Scratch4SL, whereas the control group (n = 45) was trained using Scratch. The findings indicate considerable differences in students' game experience and satisfaction, but no statistically significant difference in their learning performance and knowledge gain was identified. This study provides several design implications for user interface and game elements to inform educational practitioners and instructors about the benefits that each approach can offer students for better knowledge acquisition and deeper disciplinary understanding.

10.1007/s11423-022-10097-w,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are critical for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, thus drawing increasing attention in STEM education. More curricula and assessments, however, are needed to cultivate and measure CT for different learning goals. Maker activities have the potential to improve student CT, but more validated assessments are needed for maker activities. We developed a set of activities for students to improve and assess essential CT skills by creating real-life applications using Arduino, a microcontroller often used in maker activities. We examined the psychometric features of CT performance assessments with rubrics and the effectiveness of the maker activities on improving CT. Two high school physics teachers implemented these Arduino activities and assessments with fifteen high school students during three days in a summer program. The participating students took an internal content-involved and an external CT tests before and after participating in the program. The students also took the performance-based CT assessment at the end of the program. The data provide reliability and validity evidence of the Arduino assessment as a tool to measure CT. The pre- and post-test comparison indicates that students significantly improved their scores on the content-involved assessment aligned with the Arduino activities, but not on the content-free CT assessment. It shows that Arduino, or some equipment similar, can be used to improve students' CT skills and the Arduino maker activities can be used as performance assessments to measure students' engineering involving CT skills.

It has been defined as a 21st-century skill (Wing, Communications of the ACM, 49(3), 33–35, 2006). Unfortunately, little pedagogical research is available to guide teachers and designers when devising a CT course. This study addresses this issue by describing how a framework to teach CT to second-level students evolved. This framework, ADAPTTER, has been shown to result in a high quality, engaging, low threshold, effective, and practical course. A three-phase Educational Design Research study was employed to develop this framework. It involved six schools, eleven teachers, four content experts, and 446 students. Data was gathered using various means: teacher interviews and diaries, students' questionnaires, artefacts, and tests. The ADAPTTER framework is offered as a way for teachers and researchers to design a CT course, understand its components and have conversations around the same.

The addition of Computational Thinking (CT) becomes one more thing to add to a packed schedule and integration of CT into established courses takes major redesign of courses. One university in Maryland, U.S. developed a CT focused micro–credential for K–8 pre–service and in–service teachers. In examining pre– and post–content surveys, reflection journal entries and lesson plans, pre–service teachers report CT and pedagogical content growth in their awareness and integration of CT in their lives and future classrooms. Results indicate a CT micro–credential could be an innovative solution to adding CT content to an over–packed, pre–service curriculum. In addition, CT micro–credential courses increased pre–service teachers' knowledge and self–awareness to the feasibility to proficiently implement CT across all courses.

At the same time, teachers often see the relevance of CT as a tool to introduce problem solving and thinking strategies in the classroom. Despite the increasing use of CT in K-12, questions remain about its role in supporting teaching and learning of disciplinary ideas. While CT can be used to bring computer science to all students, we believe that it can serve a bigger purpose to explicitly teach metacognitive strategies, which play a significant role in academic outcomes. In the paper, we discuss the connections between CT and metacognition and how CT could support the development of metacognition in K-12 classrooms.

10.1007/s10643-021-01188-z,"In this research we explore the extent to which computational thinking (CT) is evident in 3–6 year-old children's free play. CT is increasingly viewed as an important aspect of a child's school learning. Typically, CT is connected to learning with computers. Yet, much of learning in the early years is play-based, spontaneous, often learner-initiated, and without technology. Teacher engagement with young learners is important in supporting learning, understanding what learners know, and also in potentially advancing a learner's understanding. The relative newness of CT for many teachers suggests that teachers may not recognize CT during play. We used several frameworks to examine CT. Video clips and images of children in the classroom setting were examined by the researchers and teachers to identify instances of CT. Evidence of CT was found in children's free play. Implications for early years' teachers are discussed.

10.1155/2023/3760957,"To improve the algorithmic dimension, critical thinking, and problem-solving ability of computational thinking (CT) in students' programming courses, first, a programming teaching model is constructed based on the scratch modular programming course. Secondly, the design process of the teaching model and the problem-solving model of visual programming are studied. Finally, a deep learning (DL) evaluation model is constructed, and the effectiveness of the designed teaching model is analyzed and evaluated. The T-test result of paired samples of CT is t = −2.08, P < 0.05. There are significant differences in the results of the two tests, and the designed teaching model can cause changes in students' CT abilities. The results reveal that the effectiveness of the teaching model based on scratch modular programming has been verified on the basis of experiments. The post-test values of the dimensions of algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, collaborative thinking, and problem-solving thinking are all higher than the pretest values, and there are individual differences. The P values are all less than 0.05, which testifies that the CT training of the designed teaching model has the algorithm dimension, critical thinking, collaborative thinking, and problem-solving ability of students' CT. The post-test values of cognitive load are all lower than the pretest values, indicating that the model has a certain positive effect on reducing cognitive load, and there is a significant difference between the pretest and post-test. In the dimension of creative thinking, the P value is 0.218, and there is no obvious difference in the dimensions of creativity and self-efficacy. It can be found from the DL evaluation that the average value of the DL knowledge and skills dimensions is greater than 3.5, and college students can reach a certain standard level in terms of knowledge and skills. The mean value of the process and method dimensions is about 3.1, and the mean value of the emotional attitudes and values is 2.77. The process and method, as well as emotional attitude and values, need to be strengthened. The DL level of college students is relatively low, and it is necessary to improve their DL level from the perspective of knowledge and skills, processes and methods, emotional attitudes and values. This research makes up for the shortcomings of traditional programming and design software to a certain extent. It has a certain reference value for researchers and teachers to carry out programming teaching practice.

10.24265/campus.2023.v28n35.03,"Various indicators allow the construction of the pillars of competitiveness in society. The evaluation of indicators constitutes inconclusive multidisciplinary challenges, and one of the premises is based on the morphological approach. The objective of the study was to describe competitiveness from complex and rhizomatic thinking through non-computational data science engineering. The study was conducted from July to December 2022 where the analysis of the regional competitiveness index (INCORE) published by the Peruvian Institute of Economics for the Southern Macro Region of Peru from 2017 to 2021 was considered. The criteria of complex and rhizomatic thinking were based on the pillars and measurement indicators on regional competitiveness and the rhizomatic model of interpretation on regional competitiveness. It is described, that each indicator does not interact with others, and at the same time does not impact by others. The conception as a product and producer oriented to social growth was not observed. Therefore, it is considered that there was a limitation on the evidence of realities for the fulfillment of development, from dimensions and variables based on social and human welfare. It is concluded that the INCORE information lacks ramifiable indicators with an impact on human development welfare. In this perspective, there is a need to demand a systemic measurement approach for the competitiveness of the Southern Macro Region of Peru. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Diversos indicadores permiten la construcción de los pilares sobre la competitividad en la sociedad. La evaluación de indicadores constituye retos multidisciplinarios no concluyentes, y una de las premisas se basa en el enfoque morfológico. El objetivo del estudio fue describir la competitividad desde el pensamiento complejo y rizomático mediante ingeniería en ciencia de dato no computacional. El estudio se realizó desde julio a diciembre de 2022 donde se consideró el análisis del índice de competitividad regional (INCORE) publicado por el Instituto Peruano de Economía para la Macro Región Sur del Perú desde el 2017 al 2021. Los criterios del pensamiento complejo y rizomático se basaron en los pilares e indicadores de medición sobre la competitividad regional y el modelo rizomático de interpretación sobre la competitividad regional. Se describe, que cada indicador no interactúa con otros, y a la vez no impacta por otros. No se observó, la concepción como producto y productor orientado al crecimiento social. Por tanto, se considera que existió limitación sobre la evidencia de realidades para el cumplimiento de desarrollo, a partir de dimensiones y variables basadas en el bienestar social y humano. Se concluye, que la información de INCORE carece de indicadores ramificables con impacto en el bienestar del desarrollo humano. En esta perspectiva, existe la necesidad que se demande un enfoque sistémico de medición para la competitividad de la Macro Región Sur del Perú.

10.3390/math10173194,"The short task methodology enhances the Bebras constructive environment, and provides an emotional context that triggers the convolution of initially biased mental models and corresponding emotional reactions into an unbiased set of conceptual models for informatics education. This provides the motivation of our research–to explore the process of pedagogical design of short informatics concept-based tasks from the standpoint of mindset formation, which allows one to build conceptual models for CT education. The aim of the research is to gain a conceptual understanding of what a short task is in the context of the global Bebras Challenge initiative. We explore the principles which should underlie the pedagogical design of short tasks for informatics education that scaffold CT. Exploration of a number of practical examples of the Bebras short tasks is the background of our research methodology. The results include an analysis of the structure of short tasks, focusing on the interaction of mental models, conceptual models, and heuristics inherent in the task design. The discussion provides a comprehensive insight into the issues of the short tasks in relation to CT and the Bebras environment. We conclude with recommendations for organizing an effective pedagogical design of a short task.

10.1007/s10643-021-01236-8,"Guided play activities were developed so that coding clubs could promote computational thinking skills in preschool children. The clubs involved fifteen children aged between 2 and 4 years, including a group of children with communication difficulties. The children took part in an action-research scoping study over three coding clubs involving six 45–60-min sessions. The activities were developed to teach computational skills and, ultimately, concepts of programming and coding. The findings suggested that the children began to develop many of the skills necessary for programming and coding as well as computational thinking skills such as collaboration, logical thinking and debugging algorithms. However, they found programming specific algorithms into Bee-Bots complicated and they needed support from adults to direct the robots along routes on simple maps. Overall, the guided play activities could be used in nurseries and preschool establishments to teach early computational thinking skills.

,"This study explores the role of socially shared regulation on computational thinking performance in cooperative learning. Ninety-four middle school students from China aged between 16 and 18 participated in this study. Forty-six students were in the experimental group, and 48 students were in the control group. Students in the experimental group learned under the socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) condition, which included planning and goal setting, task and content monitoring, and task and content evaluation. Students in the control group learned in a traditional way. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed their counterparts on the midtest and posttest. Additionally, the learning gain of the experimental group was much better from the pretest to the midtest. Different subgroups in the experimental group had different learning performances, and task monitoring and content monitoring were two important SSRL processes that led to improved computational thinking performance. Our results suggest that SSRL is beneficial for learning computational thinking subjects. Throughout the process of SSRL, different groups have different learning dynamics, and task and content monitoring plays a major role in computational thinking performance.

10.1111/ssm.12649,"In‐service teachers implementing a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curriculum centered on computational thinking (CT) work with unique content and pedagogical experiences. Understanding how curriculum design and teacher professional development affect curriculum implementation can help researchers understand the critical aspects of supporting the teacher in ""just right"" ways to learn and teach an embedded CT curriculum. We qualitatively analyzed 22 teachers' discourse through a case study approach. We identified how CT is afforded and constrained through curriculum design and teacher professional development support. Teachers expressed that the supports that were critical to their confidence and perceived ability to teach CT were (a) a program that provides ""just right"" support, (b) a program that provides options and individualization, (c) an internal personal identity that embraces continual innovation and learning, and (d) an educational system that is encouraging and supportive of the effort and creativity it requires to implement innovative and intensive embedded CT programs. These findings can inform how to support teachers to integrate CT within existing STEM curricula as a core scientific and mathematical practice and to foster student interest in computer science.

10.1080/02635143.2022.2036117,"In order for computational thinking (CT) to be successfully implemented in educational environments, teachers' CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs should be developed. The existing research on this topic is generally focused on training in-service teachers on CT to develop their self-efficacy. Conversely, the current study aims to contribute to the development of early childhood pre-service teachers' CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs through CT-integrated STEM education. In the current study, the effect of CT-integrated STEM education on CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs of early childhood pre-service teachers was explored. The study group was composed of 68 second-year early childhood pre-service teachers. All were attending a state university in the city of İstanbul during the 2020–2021 academic year. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, i.e. the control group was given only STEM education, while the experimental group was given CT-integrated STEM education. The data collection tool used in the current study was 'the scale of self-efficacy beliefs towards teaching computational thinking'. For analysis, an independent samples t-test and a paired samples t-test were used. The findings have revealed that there is a significant difference in the post-test scores on the 'scale of self-efficacy beliefs towards CT teaching' in favor of the experimental group. The effect size calculated for the difference between the mean pre-test and post-test scores of the experimental group students was found to be large. These results show that CT-integrated STEM education contributed to the development of the pre-service teachers' CT teaching self-efficacy beliefs. The current study contributes to the literature by showing that CT-integrated STEM education fosters pre-service teachers' professional development and their self-efficacy beliefs about CT teaching.

10.1007/s10798-020-09562-5,"Just as engineering and computational thinking have recently gained increased attention in pre-college school-based education, many museums and science centers have also designed exhibits and experiences to promote computational thinking and engineering learning. Recent reports suggest that computational and engineering thinking can empower each other, and engineering design can be an appropriate context for children's engagement in computational thinking. Previous studies have documented young children's abilities to engage in engineering thinking and other studies have collected evidence of young children's abilities to engage in computational thinking. However, there is little research that explores how children's engagement in both engineering and computational thinking can support each other. Hence, in this qualitative case study, we aimed to examine how 5 to 7-year-old children engage in computational thinking competencies in the context of a family based engineering design activity. This activity was conducted at a small science center exhibit. In our presented findings we map children's enactment of at least one CT competency to children's engagement in engineering design actions.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, this study employed the quasi-experiment. The experimental group students learned with the AI-based robot learning approach with the ICAP model, while the control group students learned with the conventional AI-based robot learning approach. The results showed that the proposed learning approach significantly improved students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking. However, there was no significant interaction between group and gender across all variables. It showed that the ICAP model successfully promoted female students to improve their intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking in AI-based robots.

10.5753/rbie.2022.2400,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been considered as an alternative for the development of skills considered fundamental for professionals in the 21st century. In Brazil, the importance of the CT can be observed by its insertion in the norms of the Common National Curriculum Base. Among the approaches which aim to qualify the teaching and learning process through the development of CT skills, the use of educational games stands out. In particular, a methodology for the application of an activity called Elementals RPG was previously proposed, with the goal of integrating the teaching of mathematics with the following CT concepts and techniques: abstraction of data and processes, and pattern recognition/generalization. A face-to-face case study was developed, and the results obtained gave evidence that the activity was attractive and effective for student learning. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was also a need for new alternatives to work remotely. Thus, this work complements the proposed activity with a remote tutorial for teachers and a digital game for students, both applied and evaluated in order to identify the feasibility and suitability of the proposals for the target audience.

10.33543/1102325329,"The accelerating development of technology over the past decades has brought many radical changes in all aspects of life and has unquestionably affected the functioning of our society. The expansion of the digital space and the technological innovation in industry, commerce and household have given rise to a large number of new concepts relating to digital and information technology and their use. In the context of supporting these activities and needs, the FEP document has been updated for the educational area Information and Communication Technology in elementary schools but also in general and technical secondary schools. This innovation is built primarily on the development of computational thinking, which is based on two pillars--algorithmization/programming and educational robotics. The present paper uses educational research to analyse the area of educational robotics as one of the important tools for promoting the concept of developing computational thinking including a description of the specific tools for the implementation of this type of teaching. The aim of the research study was to analyse the current level of pupils' awareness of and practical experience with educational robotics, both in school and in extracurricular activities. The research tool for data collection was an online questionnaire designed by the authors.

,"Despite increasing attention to the potential benefits of infusing computational thinking into content area classrooms, more research is needed to examine how teachers integrate disciplinary content and CT as part of their pedagogical practices. This study traces how middle and high school teachers (n = 24) drew on their existing knowledge and their experiences in a STEM professional development program to infuse CT into their teaching. Our work is grounded in theories of TPACK and TPACK-CT, which leverage teachers' knowledge of technology for computational thinking (CT), CT as a disciplinary pedagogical practice, and STEM content knowledge. Findings identify three key pedagogical supports that teachers utilized and transformed as they taught CT-infused lessons (articulating a key purpose for CT infusion, scaffolding, and collaborative contexts), as well as barriers that caused teachers to adapt or abandon their lessons. Implications include suggestions for future research on CT infusion into secondary classrooms, as well as broader recommendations to support teachers in applying STEM professional development content to classroom practice.

10.1080/10494820.2022.2042311,"As a core competence in 21st century, computational thinking (CT) is of great significance for undergraduates. However, there are few researches on the CT evaluation about undergraduates, and nor do a theoretical framework. Additionally, it is not clear what factors may affect their CT development. Therefore, according to Marzano's new taxonomy of educational objectives, this study constructed a theoretical framework for the CT evaluation, which included the field of the CT knowledge and the CT system. Then a Computational thinking scale (CTS) among 737 undergraduates was verified. CTS was adopted to evaluate undergraduates' CT skills, and the factors that may affect their CT skills are discussed according to the framework. The results showed that: (1) the CTS had sufficient reliability and validity among the sample undergraduates; (2) the CT skills of the sample undergraduates were in the middle and upper level (M = 15.71, SD = 2.18); (3) personal factors (gender and major) and contextual factors (educational environment and school support) are related to undergraduates' CT skills. Several suggestions and countermeasures were put forward for the undergraduates' CT cultivation on the framework, which will provide a reference for CT in undergraduate education.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationships between computational thinking skills, the Big Five personality factors, and learning motivation using structural equation modeling (SEM). The research administered the computational thinking scale, NEO FFI scale, and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire to a sample of 92 students pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Engineering. Based on the result analysis, it was determined that both personality and learning motivation had positive and significant impacts on computation thinking skills. Personality had a major contribution to the prediction of CT, with consciousness being the most influential predictor. The findings of this study suggest that educators and academics should focus on the significance of the psychological side of CT for the improvement of students' CT skills.

10.1080/10494820.2021.1983610,"Computational thinking is an important skill in computer science since the 1960s, and it is closely related to problem solving. Almost all research related to computational thinking mentions problem solving. Although some research has been conducted on computational thinking, few studies examined the impact of personal traits on students' computation thinking skills and problem solving. This study modeled cooperative attitudes of programming, learning style, self-regulation, and enjoyment as its key elements, investigated personal traits as predictors of problem-solving skills, and examined the correlation between variables and computational thinking. The 252 research participants were all sixth-grade students in an elementary school in Taipei, Taiwan. After a 10-week experimental curriculum, a posttest was conducted, and a total of 244 observations were collected. Correlation and regression analyses show that computational thinking is positively correlated with problem-solving skills, and learning style has the predictive ability for computational thinking. Furthermore, cooperative attitude and self-regulation of programming are important variables for predicting problem-solving skills; the degree of students' enjoyment in the curriculum will affect the cooperative attitude and self-regulation of their programming. In summary, the personal traits above could improve the participants' problem-solving skills hierarchically and help them achieve better computational thinking.

10.1111/jcal.12845,"Background: Collaboration has commonly been integrated in computational thinking education to foster novice learning. While the majority of existing studies on developing students' CT skills have been based on competency or personality factors, social factors have been largely ignored. Objectives: This systematic review, framed by social cognitive learning theories, aims to unravel the influencing factors of collaboration in developing computational thinking skills in K‐12 education. Methods: We searched four databases and located 79 publications for synthesis analysis to identify 10 social cognitive factors from personal and learning environmental perspectives. Personal factors are gender, prior knowledge, and motivational attitudes, while the learning environmental factors are roles, partnership, interaction, culture, tools, tasks, and scaffolding. Results and Conclusions: We examined the following five major issues: (a) collaboration elements designed in learning activities; (b) social cognitive factors that might influence the development of computational thinking; (c) the influences caused by social cognitive factors; (d) students' perceived benefits of collaboration; (e) major challenges of integrating collaboration in computational thinking education. The most reported challenges in collaborative classrooms are students' misunderstanding of computational thinking knowledge, negative sentiments, and communication problems. Accordingly, a design framework to facilitate collaborative learning activities was proposed. The design framework can provide a more focused research avenue for examining the effects of collaboration in the development of computational thinking in K‐12 education. Lay Description: What is already known about the topic?: Collaboration has commonly been integrated in computational thinking (CT) education to foster novice learning in K‐12 education.There have been disputes regarding the effectiveness of collaboration in achieving learning outcomes.There is a need for further examination of the influencing factors of collaboration, which might influence students' CT performances. What does this paper add?: Our review identified personal factors (i.e., gender, prior knowledge, and motivational attitudes) and learning environmental factors (i.e., roles, partnership, interaction, culture, tools, tasks, and scaffolding), and revealed their influences in students' CT performances in K‐12 education.The synthesis of students' authentic opinions can yield insights to the possible mechanism of how collaboration can bring benefits to students' CT performances.The design framework generated from the review can shed lights on design an effective learning environment which integrates collaboration in K‐12 CT education. Implications for practice and/or policy?: The collaborative learning process of CT is complex, whereby the effects of social cognitive factors do not stand‐alone but are influenced by personal and learning environmental factors simultaneously.Taking the identified challenges of students, instructors, and operation can help smooth organization of collaborative learning activities of K‐12 CT education.Future students could look more in‐depth into the impacts of the social and situation factors in developing CT.

10.1111/jcal.12819,"Background: Owing to the exponential growth of three‐dimensional (3D) environments amongst researchers and educators to create simulation games (SGs) in primary education, there is a growing interest to examine their potential support in computer science courses instead of visual programming environments. Objectives: This study explores the relationships between students' learning performance, focusing on computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development, in association with their cognitive load (mental load and mental effort) and emotions (happiness, anger, anxiety, sadness) by playing SGs. Methods: A total of two hundred and ninety participants (n = 290) in fifth‐grade classes (10–11 years old) of Greek primary schools completed all pre‐and post‐intervention tests. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted over a 14‐week timetable course and in two comparison conditions, in which a SG was created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL and Scratch for the experimental group (n = 145) and the control group (n = 145), respectively. To further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SG in each teaching intervention, an exploration of relationships between students' learning performance, cognitive load, and emotions through multiple analyses, depending on correlation, t‐tests, correlation, and hierarchal regression was delivered. Results and Conclusions: The findings indicate that the proposed SG created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL positively affected students' emotions and cognitive load, whereas there was no significant difference in learning gain between the two groups. Implications: The study provides empirical evidence on the effects of SGs on students' knowledge acquisition, highlighting the importance of considering both cognitive and emotional components in the design of these games. The findings also offer valuable insights for implications policy and practice. Lay Description: What is already known: Interactive environments can support the development of students' computational thinking (CT) and programming skills due to a wide range of digital elements/features that expand the boundaries where learning can happen.CT is a 21st‐century skill to be on top with others, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic for future generations of students to tackle real‐life problems.Despite a broad consensus on the increasing number of interactive environments, there is no dedicated measurement of their effects on students' performance and their possible association with psychological constructs. What this paper adds: This study explores any possible relationships amongst students' CT skills, emotions, and cognitive load for programming courses in fifth‐grade (10–11 years old) classes of primary education by playing a simulation game (SG).The proposed SG was created by using two interactive environments that project different 2D/3D user interface and game elements (e.g., special effects, scenes, animations, feedback, challenges, goal clarity, and scripted interaction).A quasi‐experimental study was conducted over a 14‐week timetable course and in two comparison conditions, in which the proposed SG was created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL and Scratch for the experimental group (n = 145) and the control group (n = 145), respectively. Implications for practice and/or policy: In‐game scenario and students' embodied experiences can increase CT vocabulary acquisition, understanding, and expression of solution plans via visual coding.A practical roadmap for practitioners and instructors proposed how to purposefully integrate elements/features into interactive environments.Problem‐solving exercises in a simulated reality can become interesting and reduce students' cognitive load, when they are taking part in enjoyable and playful settings.

10.1111/jcal.12818,"Background: Computational thinking (CT) has become a crucial skill for individuals in the 21st century, and while more educators are starting to recognize the importance of CT education, there is still a lack of research on how to teach young children CT, particularly outside of traditional school settings. Objectives: To fill the gap in knowledge, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a web‐based parent education program on improving children's CT skills. Additionally, we sought to determine if children's age, gender and family socioeconomic status had any impact on the development of CT skills. Methods: We selected 86 adult–child pairs in the K3 age group to participate in a 4‐week intervention program using a quasi‐experimental approach. Results: After 4 weeks, children in the intervention group had improved their CT skills more than their peers in the control group. This shows that the intervention was successful in enhancing children's CT skills. Age had a moderating effect on CT enhancement, with older children showing a more significant improvement than younger children. However, children's gender and family socioeconomic status did not have any moderating effects. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CT education can be effectively implemented in the home setting through web‐mediated parent education. Encouraging the use of unplugged CT activities at home can aid children in acquiring CT skills. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) education can be started at the early childhood stage.Both plugged‐in and unplugged activities can promote children's CT.Unplugged activities have many advantages and are suitable for young children. What this paper adds: Web‐mediated parent education is useful for equipping parents with the knowledge and skills to conduct CT activities at home.CT education has a positive effect on children in the home setting.Parents play an important leading role in children's CT education.Parent–child unplugged activities are beneficial to children's CT enhancement. Implications for practice and/or policy: A web‐mediated approach is an appropriate way to encourage parent participation in CT training.CT‐related parent education should be scaled up so that parents can play an active educational role at home.Unplugged CT activities should be designed more for the home settings in addition to school settings.

10.1080/10494820.2021.1946564,"In modern society technology is widely used and, with the digitization of many services, this is an upward trend. Therefore, computational thinking (CT) is an increasingly important concept; an aspect that is being reflected on educational policies and the extracurricular offer of different countries. This study aims to look at the efficacy of private after-school extracurricular robotics activities, controlling fluid intelligence (Gf), a determining aspect in solving novel problems. A sample of 112 fifth-grade Spanish students was chosen, who completed two tests, the computational thinking test (CTt) (Román-González, 2016) and the KBIT fluid intelligence subtest (Kaufman, 1990). The results showed a great influence of Gf on the prediction of CT and significant differences between the students that had not attended after-school extracurricular classes and those that had attended for two or more years. Thus, this study substantiates the effectiveness of private extracurricular classes in promoting CT in the long term. Given the importance of CT nowadays, legislators should consider to include CT in compulsory education because private extracurricular classes could promote inequity.

Although some research has been conducted on computational thinking, few studies examined the impact of learning activities on students' computation thinking skills from the perspective of cognitive development. Based on the theory of scaffolding instruction, a progressive thinking training approach with flowcharts was proposed to cultivate students' computational thinking skills. A quasi-experiment was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Forty-nine Chinese tertiary students undertaking a programming course were randomly assigned into two groups – the experimental and control groups. During the course, the experimental group received progressive training, and the control group received non-progressive training. The results showed that the experimental group gained a significantly higher level of academic achievement than the control group. Meanwhile, the experimental group showed a remarkable improvement in programming self-efficacy. Furthermore, the participants in the experimental group showed a higher level of computational thinking skills, including cooperative learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. In summary, the progressive thinking training approach with flowcharts could not only improve the participants' computational thinking skills and programming self-efficacy, but also help them to achieve better academic outcomes.

This study explores design-based learning (DBL) in elementary students to examine the development of computational thinking and to support knowledge construction in designing final products. An experimental design was used with 64 students; divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used a DBL approach with worksheets aimed at students designing their own final product design, while the control group was taught by the traditional approach with worksheets for redoing, practicing and designing their final product. Pre and posttests were used for data collection and evaluation scheme developed to score the final product. The finding showed no significant difference in the development of computational thinking between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in designing the final product between the two groups. Therefore, DBL supported elementary students in designing the final product although redesigning curricula by integrating both teaching methods is suggested for the greater achievement of computational thinking.

10.1080/10494820.2021.1928236,"Previous research suggests that there should be a correlation between computational thinking and traditional cognitive and motor skills. At present, academia either considers cognitive skills a part of computational thinking, or investigates the correlation between computational thinking and cognitive skills. Current research on computational thinking focuses on the design of teaching models to improve computational thinking ability and on measures for evaluating computational thinking. The association of computational thinking with motor skills is rarely discussed. From the perspective of embodied cognition theory, an association must exist, but its mechanisms have not been studied. Therefore, this study explores the effect of the teaching model of creative problem solving (CPS) on computational thinking and its internal correlation with technical skills. It was found that CPS can not only improve the computational thinking ability of students majoring in engineering, but also promote their corresponding motor skills. However, the students' previous academic background had a certain influence on their learning outcomes. Students at universities of technology experienced a greater improvement in their computational thinking and motor skills than students at general universities. There is a certain correlation between computational thinking and motor skills, and the interaction between them should be properly considered in future teaching and curriculum design so as to improve students' learning effectiveness.

10.1016/j.ecresq.2023.05.013,"• This paper presents a framework for designing formative assessments of computational thinking in early childhood that starts by observing the errors that children make when engaging in coding tasks. • The errors children make while learning how to code serve as indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities and provide information about how their computational thinking knowledge is still developing. • Our identification of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities provide insight into very early understandings of what potential patterns and levels of thinking may look like in early childhood computational thinking. With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand , KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p =.048.

In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see ""seeds of CT"" in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

Computational thinking is the integration of various thinking methods, such as mathematical thinking and engineering thinking, and its core features are “abstract” and “automatic and effective execution”. In the field of law, the function of computational thinking is reflected in properly abstract legal problems, and the solution can be automatically implemented by law enforcement subjects including person, machine or man-machine combination through appropriate procedures, that is, to improve the scientific nature of legislation and ensure the effective implementation of law. In the process of legislation, how to choose the abstract level is the key to affect the scientific nature of legislation, and a reasonable procedural mechanism can make the law automatically and effectively implemented. In the practice of law enforcement, finding the equivalence relationship through the appropriate abstractions can transform the complex and difficult problems into relatively easy problems to solve. Computational thinking can be called the neglected “pearl” on the crown of computational law. Its function and role in the legal field have not been fully recognized and explored by the legal circle, and its value needs to be further explored.

10.1007/s11423-021-10031-6,"This paper presents a game-design workshop built around a digital art installation featuring video games displayed over a real-world skyscraper to stimulate students' interest in computer science and a study testing its short-term effects on improving middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and attitudes towards computing. Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop.

10.1111/jcal.12850,"Background: Today, computational thinking (CT), which is considered to be a form of literacy, has taken its place in the ICT curriculum of many countries at the K‐12 level. Therefore, there is a need for more evidence with regards to a theoretical and practical understanding of CT skills' development of K‐12 students. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of an unplugged coding course on primary school students' development of CT skills, differences in their CT skills in terms of socio‐demographics such as gender, computer ownership, daily computer use, and home Internet access, and the relationship between their CT and 21st century skills. Methods: The research was based a quasi‐experimental design with one‐group pretest‐posttest with follow‐up. The CT skills of 212 third and fourth grade students at a public primary school of Turkey were measured with a CT Skills Test before, after, and about ten weeks following having attended an unplugged coding course. Results and Conclusions: The results of the study showed that the unplugged coding course statistically significantly improved the participants' CT skills, specifically in algorithmic design, abstraction, evaluation, decomposition, and generalization. Moreover, the findings indicated that primary school students' CT skills were not associated with their socio‐demographics. In addition, the students' CT skills were found to be positively and statistically significantly correlated with their collaboration and communication skills. Implications: This study contributes to understanding of the effects of unplugged activities on the development of primary school students' CT skills, which is beneficial to teaching practices for CT skills in the primary education.

10.1080/10494820.2021.1986725,"In this paper we propose a universal curricular framework that is intended to aid K-6 schoolteachers holistically and humanistically developing their students' computational thinking (CT) skills (e.g. algorithmic thinking, abstraction, decomposition, generalization, patterns recognition, evaluation, and logical thinking). This framework, which can be applied to any subject at the elementary school level, is grounded on specific principles that we have gleaned from both learning theories and considerations on child development. New media literacy skills (NML) and social-emotional skills are also targeted, as they are strongly connected with CT skills and display bidirectional linkages that can comprehensively benefit students in various ways (cognitively, imaginatively/creatively, materially, socially, and affectively/emotionally) without the need for digital technologies or coding. The universal nature of our curricular proposal rests on the following factors: it is based on a cross-disciplinary approach that can be applied in ways that mirror real life; CT is seen as a universal skill that should be learned by everyone, not just computer scientists, and is applicable to every aspect of daily life; one-sided intellectualism is avoided; and, lastly, the resulting classroom practices have an impact on and are influenced by children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.

10.1080/10494820.2021.1931891,"The cultivation of computational thinking (CT) skills is a key issue in talent cultivation today. This study reported a meta-analysis of 22 empirical studies to determine the effectiveness of using educational games to improve students' CT skills and the influence of various factors in instructional design on acquiring CT skills. The results showed that: (a) educational games can promote the improvement of students' CT skills (Hedges' g = 0.766, p = 0.000); (b) the overall effect is at the upper-middle level (95%CI [0.580, 0.951]); (c) The positive connection between educational games and CT skills is affected by sample size, grades level, game usage mode, and game tools. Controlling the class size to less than 50 students and the reasonable choice of game tools and usage modes are more conducive to promoting students' CT skills. In sum, we suggested that the educational game teaching process should be rationally planned, and technology should be fully utilized to develop students' CT skills. The above findings are of great significance to promote the improvement of students' CT skills through educational games in the future.

10.1016/j.ecresq.2023.05.014,"• A pedagogically planned and scaffolding scenario-based design teaching process established novice preschool programmers with overall programming skills in a tangible programming context. • Two types of debugging knowledge emerged: i) syntactic and ii) semantic. The second type was revealed to be more complex for children to develop, mainly when two bugs occurred within the same program. • Half of the children presented complete and functional programs. Many children applied effective debugging strategies from their coding experience, although they were not involved in activities focused on debugging. • A dominant debug strategy is composing a 'new program'. Two more strategies emerged: verbal and 'pseudocode'. The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

10.5281/zenodo.5651282,"Computational thinking is a competency that benefits problem solving as in computer sciences as in the other disciplines and everyday life. Currently, it is of interest to include computational thinking in the curricula of all educational levels, however, there are shortcomings such as the lack of evaluation tools in real contexts and the nonexistence of application models oriented on each discipline. This essay's goal is to show the arguments that support these shortcomings. First, we present a discussion about the computational thinking concept. Later, we introduce a common framework used to design evaluations in computer sciences. After, to contextualize the causes of the evaluation's shortcomings on computational thinking, we compare with a framework used in medicine. The analysis suggests that the shortcomings are caused by the utilization of Bloom's taxonomy as the framework.

We first present a methodological framework for the analysis of embodied interaction with technology captured through video recording. The framework brings together a social semiotic approach to multimodality with the philosophical and theoretical roots of embodied cognition. We then demonstrate the application of the framework by exploring how the computational thinking of two fifth grade learners emerged as an embodied phenomenon during an educational robotics activity. The findings suggest that, for young children, computational thinking was extended to include the structures in the environment and guided by their embodiment of mathematical concepts. Specifically, the participants repeatedly used their bodies to simulate different possibilities for action while incorporating both perceptual and formal multiplicative reasoning strategies to conceptualize the robot's movements. Implications for the design of embodied educational robotics activities and future application of the methodological framework are discussed.

,"In the revised curriculum 2017, computational thinking skills have been integrated into the curriculum contents of all existing subjects in primary and secondary schools in Malaysia. The newly revised curriculum calls for an urgent need to prepare teachers to deliver computational thinking skills in the classroom and assess the teaching and learning outcomes of computational thinking skills. This paper reports the development of an assessment rubric, myCTRubric, designed to evaluate the teaching and learning outcomes of the newly integrated computational thinking skills among primary school students in Malaysia. An action research approach guided the design and development of myCTRubric. myCTRubric was reviewed and validated by a panel of computational thinking subject matter experts. Analyses of results show that myCTRubric is reliable and has strong content validity. This pioneering work is expected to lend insights into the teaching and learning practices of computational thinking in Malaysian classrooms and served as a practical guideline for future research.

10.1155/2024/5044787,"Digital computers were invented in the 1940s. They are sophisticated and versatile machines whose functioning is grounded in elaborate theory. Advances in theory and the availability of computers helped computer science to develop as an academic discipline, and university departments for the same started coming up in the 1960s. Computer science covers all phenomenon related to computers and consists primarily of man-made laws governing building, programming, and using computers. Computational thinking is a way of thinking influenced by computers and computer science. There are two schools of thought on computational thinking. The first school sees computational thinking as the use of computers to explore the world, while the other sees computational thinking as the application of concepts from computer science to solve real-world problems. Scholars typically agree that computational thinking has four essential components, viz., abstraction, decomposition, algorithm design, and generalization. Computational thinking is often feted by computer scientists as a useful skill that can be used by anybody anywhere. However, it is necessary to find out ways for successfully using computational thinking in domains other than computer science before it can be declared a universal skill.

Therefore, understanding how CT skills can be developed is essential. This research explores how CT skills can be developed for programming through competitive, physical, and tactile games. The CT elements in this research focus on four major programming concepts, which are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We have conducted game activities through several algorithms that include sorting, swapping, and graph algorithms and analyzed how the game affects the student experience (SX) in understanding the CT concept in those algorithms. We have applied the quadrilateral method approach to the data collection and analysis. The data was obtained through observation, interview/survey based on six SX criteria (attention, engagement, awareness, satisfaction, confidence, and performance), and performances of the conducted game activities were compared. The results of the quadrilation of the data collected show a positive impact on the SX, highlight the effectiveness of the competitive, physical, and tactile game approach proposed in this research towards programming and CT skills development.

Se utilizó un diseño cuasiexperimental para comparar un grupo de estudiantes de LIE++ con un grupo de estudiantes de otra propuesta llamada LIEGuías que enfatiza aprendizajes con tecnologías digitales. En el estudio participaron 14.795 estudiantes, respondiendo voluntariamente una prueba en línea que se construyó y validó para estimar los puntajes alcanzados en PC. Los resultados mostraron que los estudiantes participantes de LIE++ obtuvieron mejores puntajes en comparación con el grupo de LIEGuías y mediante un modelo de regresión multinivel se identificaron que variables personales y sociales de los estudiantes y de la misma ejecución de la propuesta inciden en el favorecimiento de estos aprendizajes. Esta investigación es un primer acercamiento al tema en este contexto, que se refiere a la importancia de brindar oportunidades educativas que apunten a conocimientos y habilidades más avanzadas de la computación, así como a la relevancia de seguir desarrollando herramientas y metodologías que ayuden a generar evidencias sobre el PC en el ámbito educativo y así mejorar las intervenciones educativas.

,"The technology is an essential educational resource in people daily live. It has been consolidated as a powerful tool for social transformation able to provide opportunities of reflection, actuation and development in several aspects of our society. Consequently, the learning of the Computational Thinking (CT) paradigm is a valuable instrument in the acquisition of several cognitive abilities to use or handle technology challenges, such as logic reasoning, creativity, innovation, problem resolution, etc. This paper aims to describe our initiative of teaching CT to students in Monte Carmelo, State of Minas Gerais, through two workshops developed on the concepts of Unplugged Computation and Scratch. To be specific, the workshops were offered to fifth grade students of a public elementary school. As results, the initiative promoted a notable engagement of the students regarding the operation, construction, and development of computational technologies as well as contributed to improve interpersonal relationships among them.

10.1155/2022/2543872,"The starting point of this study is to improve the realistic problem of high failure rate of product innovation and improve the success rate of product innovation. First, starting from the relationship between user demand and innovation, this study constructs a product innovation-demand screening system model from a macro perspective and describes the circular promotion relationship between demand and innovation. Second, apply computational thinking to further characterize the system model. From the point of view of mining frequent item sets, this paper constructs an analysis model of product innovation intention from a microscopic perspective and makes a correlation analysis of innovation and demand, providing technical support for the combination and screening of innovation and demand. The model runs in a Python environment. This study uses the Apriori algorithm to improve the efficiency of frequent set mining. This model has no specific restrictions on the selected users, the way to select demand data is broad, and the data are easy to obtain. The use of large amounts of data for analysis also reduces the bias of experts and leading users in evaluating and screening innovation intentions. The simulation of the operation and screening efficiency of the product innovation intention analysis model shows that (1) the model runs effectively. (2) The number of innovation intentions screened by the model can be regulated by adjusting only two variables: min_support and min_confidence. However, the number of strong association rules is more sensitive to the adjustment of min_support. (3) The innovation intention analysis model has significantly improved the efficiency of innovation intention screening. (4) Adjusting the innovation portfolio according to the analysis results of innovation intention can make new products more popular.

10.1007/s11423-021-10016-5,"Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill and an analytical ability that children in the twenty-first century should develop. Students should begin to work with algorithmic problem-solving and computational methods in K-12. Drawing on a conceptual framework (IGGIA) that combines CT and problem-solving, this study designed and implemented an interdisciplinary Scratch course in a primary school, examined the impact of the new problem-solving instructional approach (the adapted IGGIA) on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy, and explored the gender differences in these two aspects. A pretest–posttest nonequivalent group design was conducted among 63 fifth-grade students in two computer science classes over 14 weeks. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the administration of CT scales, Scratch artifacts analysis and focus group interviews. The results revealed that the adapted IGGIA (1) significantly improved the CT skills of primary school students; (2) had a significant positive impact on pupils' CT self-efficacy, especially on their critical thinking, algorithmic thinking and problem-solving; and (3) significantly enhanced girls' CT skills and self-efficacy. These findings indicated that problem-solving instructional approaches could promote both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of students' deeper computational learning.

10.1111/bjet.13090,"Research relating to the development of computational thinking (CT) at primary school level is still in its infancy despite indications that it is most effective when introduced in primary/early secondary education. Teachers are pivotal to ensuring children develop CT, so it is essential they are effectively prepared, starting at preservice level, to incorporate CT into pedagogical practices. Grounded in constructionist principles and adopting the stance that CT be developed as part of subject areas other than computer science, this qualitative study presents findings focused on the understandings of CT of 51 preservice teachers who engaged in a digital learning specialism. Carried out over a 2‐year period, the research investigated preservice teachers' understandings of CT and how the design of the specialism helped to develop their understanding. Findings highlight deep understandings of CT among the preservice teachers who were able to make connections between constructionism and the development of CT. They also demonstrated a high level of pedagogical knowledge, indicating they understood why they designed particular challenges for children as part of their classroom experience. Findings are relevant for the design of teacher preparation programmes illustrating how CT can be effectively embedded to combine theory and practice. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Existing research base in relation to preservice teacher education and computational thinking is limited.When computational thinking is introduced as part of initial teacher education, preservice teachers: develop more accurate and increased understandings of computational thinkingdemonstrate more positive attitudes towards the implementation of computational thinking in the classroom.Duration of module seems to be a significant factor. A 1‐week module might be enough to develop preservice teachers' surface‐level understanding of computational thinking, but it would not provide them with enough knowledge to embed computational thinking in meaningful ways in the classroom (Yadav et al., 2014).What this paper adds Adopting the stance that computational thinking should be developed as part of subject areas other than computer science.This paper presents and discusses findings from the implementation of a model for preservice teacher education grounded in constructionism, that supports preservice primary teachers in building an understanding of CT as well as the pedagogical knowledge necessary for embedding CT into their classroom practice.Implications for practice and/or policy The insights gained from this study are particularly relevant for the design of teacher preparation programmes indicating how CT can be effectively embedded to combine theory and practice.This will ensure that CT concepts are not developed in a decontexualised manner but are embedded within the prescribed curriculum in a relevant and meaningful manner.

10.1111/bjet.13085,"In this paper, we discuss the need for new approaches to research regarding coding to support students in developing practices in computational thinking, such as abstraction and decomposition, in multidisciplinary contexts. We explore students' activities with a tool integrating constructionist textual programming activity with game‐based learning and specifically game modding. In this context, we designed a programmable 'design‐to‐play' game developed with the computational environment MaLT2. MaLT2 offers the affordances of textual programming, dynamic manipulation, and 3D navigation for the design of 3D animated models aiming to give children access to, otherwise, complex, computational and mathematical ideas. To develop an understanding of children's learning activity regarding computational practices, we organised an empirical study with middle‐school students, who played a game called 'Code‐the‐Mime'. It is a charades‐based game in which the players manipulate, programme, and modify a digital human model to describe a word to their teammates. The preliminary findings indicate that the affordances of MaLT2 in conjunction with the game context enabled students to express and develop key computational practices, including decomposition, pattern recognition, analysis and abstraction, in a meaningful and multidisciplinary context. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Computational Thinking is considered a key 21st‐century skill in preparing the young to become digital citizens. It involves concepts and practices that can be used to solve problems computationally across multiple fields. However, there is still limited knowledge of how students develop computational practices, such as abstraction, pattern recognition, decomposition, and how they may express and apply them in diverse contexts. Students' engagement with computational practices is unlikely to be supported either by closed, simplified coding tasks or higher‐level advanced programming exercises. There is a need to clarify the manifestation of these practices and how they can be realised and expressed and used by learners in meaningful and transdisciplinary contexts.What this paper adds It suggests the design of constructionist computational games that integrate design and programming into the gameplay, aiming to engage students with computational practices in a multidisciplinary, authentic context. It provides an example of a 'design‐to‐play' charades‐like game, developed in a 3D modelling programming environment, that embeds real‐life representations into computational design, to enable 'syntonic learning' of computational practices. Furthermore, it analyses student learning activity to elaborate on arguments and issues related to this approach.Implications for practice and/or policy There is added value in disconnecting computational thinking from positivist diagnostic approaches related to respective concepts and studying it in ways more related to realistic problem‐solving situations and multidisciplinary contexts. The study contributes to the scientific clarification of computational practices concerning how they are being realised and expressed by the students in different contexts through an original example of educational practice. The discussed approach and tools can contribute to the design and development of innovative digital media, embedding affordances for concepts and practices while maintaining relevance and interest for their users.

10.1111/bjet.13157,"Computational thinking (CT), which is a cognitive skill used to solve problems with computational solutions, has drawn increasing attention among researchers and practitioners due to the growing recognition of CT competence as a 21st century skill. Collaboration is commonly integrated into CT education to facilitate novice learning, but there is inadequate knowledge regarding the influences of collaboration in CT education. This meta‐analysis examined the overall effects on the cognitive, social and affective competencies of collaborative versus individual problem solving in CT through programming. We identified 33 publications involving 4717 learners, which allowed for 220 effect size comparisons. We found a medium effect size (Hedges' g = 0.562; p < 0.001) in favour of collaborative problem solving on cognitive learning outcomes and a small effect size (Hedges' g = 0.316; p < 0.01) on affective learning outcomes using a random‐effects model. Categorical moderator analysis revealed the moderating effects of educational level, programming environment, study duration, grouping method and group size. The competency model that was generated from the synthesized literature on collaborative computational problem solving yielded insights into the learning design and assessment of relevant activities. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about the topic?Although professional programming usually requires collaboration to accomplish common goals in the work environment, programming is predominantly taught on an individual basis in educational settings.Some intervention studies have reported inconsistent learning outcomes (positive and negative) from integrating collaborative problem solving (CPS) into programming education.There is a need for further scrutiny and exploration of the role of collaboration in the process of learning to program.What does this paper add?Our meta‐analysis showed that CPS is an effective pedagogical tool for developing students' cognitive, affective and social competencies.The moderator analysis revealed that CPS in programming has cognitive benefits irrespective of grouping method, group size and educational levels; however, there is a need for caution in regard to designing collaborative problem‐solving activities for different programming environments and durations.The model generated from the literature synthesis can yield insights into better assessing and designing collaborative problem‐solving activities.Implications for practice and/or policy?Integrating CPS into programming education can prepare students with 21st century skills.Social and affective competencies are crucial to students' learning capacity, which is an issue that needs to be better assessed.Future studies could look more rigorously into the effects of CPS in visual programming and robotics programming among younger age groups, such as primary or middle school students.

10.1007/s11423-021-10034-3,"This study investigated how a computer science (CS) problem-based curriculum impacted elementary students' CS learning and attitudes. Four sixth-grade teachers and 200 of their students participated in the study. Researchers developed a CS curriculum in collaboration with the teachers, which consisted of two main units: (1) an introduction to block-based coding and (2) a problem-based learning (PBL) applied coding project. Overall, students significantly improved their knowledge of CT concepts after the introductory block-based coding lessons and retained that knowledge after completing the PBL activities approximately three months later. Results suggest that Event and Parallelism were challenging concepts for most of the students, whereas Loop and Sequence were easily grasped by most of the students. Further analysis based on prior knowledge levels revealed that the high-prior knowledge (HK) group outperformed the low-prior knowledge (LK) group on every measure. However, LK narrowed the gap of CT concepts after the introductory block-based coding lessons. Students also communicated relatively positive attitudes towards CS at the conclusion of the PBL unit. These results provide support for further exploring the integration of inquiry-oriented instructional strategies such as PBL to support CS instruction.

10.1007/s11423-021-10021-8,"Social learning theory posits that learning is most effective when providing learners with opportunities to observe and interact with peers. Unfortunately, current K-12 programming education overemphasizes individual learning and discourages learners from observing and interacting with others. The Scratch online community provides youth opportunities to actively participate in the community by allowing them to observe and interact with others. However, it is unclear what motivates learners' active participation in the Scratch online community. With a large-scale database with more than two hundred thousand Scratch projects, this study explored the impact of the computational thinking reflected in Scratch projects on users' participation. We examined Scratch's online users' computational thinking profile via clustering analysis on the projects they created, then studied the influence of computational thinking level reflected in projects on the users' participation through causal analysis. The clustering analysis revealed three clusters of learners, and the advanced learners did not create more projects than others but their projects attract more participation from peers. Our statistic analysis finds a low to moderate strength of correlation between the computational thinking level reflected in projects and their popularity. However, the further causal analysis suggests that the computational thinking level reflected in projects fails to causally affect learners' participation. Our results suggest that instructors should not only attach importance to the development of basic CT skills of youth but also do well to find ways to get youth to participate actively in social interaction activity during the programming process.

10.1111/bjet.13092,"Performance in and perceptions of computational thinking (CT) are considered vital dimensions for comprehensively assessing CT skills of students. In this study, secondary school students' CT performance and their perceptions were examined in terms of certain variables including gender, grade level, achievement and self‐efficacy. Casual‐comparative and correlational methods were used. The sample of the study consisted of a total of 328 fifth‐ and sixth‐grade (10–12 years old) secondary school students taking visual programming lessons. CT performance and perception tests were employed as data collection tools. The results show that CT performance of boys was higher than that of girls. A significant difference was found in both CT performance and perception depending on grades. The results show that achievement in math positively affected CT performance and perception. However, achievement in IT affected CT performance less than achievement in math. Implications are discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices for improving CT skills in secondary schools and directions for further research. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Due to the complex structure of computational thinking (CT) in association with computers, cognition, learning and psychology, CT skills should be evaluated from a variety of perspectives.CT performance and perception are considered vital dimensions for comprehensively assessing students' CT skills.What this paper adds This paper proposes a CT performance test and a CT perception scale for secondary school students to explore their skills in terms of certain variables including gender, grade level and achievements in math and information technology (IT) courses.This paper provides some evidence that CT performance of boys is better than that of girls. A significant difference was found in both CT performance and perception depending on grades. The results of the study show that math course achievement positively affected CT performance and perception. However, IT course achievement affected CT performance less than math course achievement.Implications for practice and/or policy CT performance is affected by different variables. Therefore, it may be beneficial to include specific topics in the curriculum that involve the use of more CT skills.Girls' interest and participation in practices such as programming can be encouraged.Teachers should provide students with cognitive scaffolding to help them and to have them collaborate with each other during CT activities, especially at higher grades.IT course content should include systematic and comprehensive CT activities to improve students' CT skills. We suggest developing and implementing a holistic curriculum combined with IT and math lessons to improve students' CT performance.

Prior research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the developmental context and social structure of complex social situations through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions, learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a multiple-baseline design across subjects. After three stages of testing and assessments, the results showed that incorporating AR effectively piqued the interest of children with ASD in learning. In particular, combining social stories and computational thinking game elements as instructional strategies helped children with ASD understand social tasks and contextual sequences. These intervention strategies also indirectly manifested in changes in their behavioral abilities and improvements in social reciprocity skills.

10.1080/10494820.2023.2249049,"Many professionals consider computational thinking an essential skill in the twenty-first century. Furthermore, some studies demonstrate that computer-based networking skills and digital environments can improve computational thinking. A challenging question to be addressed is whether informal learning in a digital context is related to computational thinking and whether it could mediate the role in networking skills and computational thinking. This study addresses the potential relationship between higher education students’ computer-based networking skills and their computational thinking by means of the mediation of digital informal learning. The study sample comprised 351 students at Shiraz University in Iran. The results, found through structural equation modeling, indicated that networking skills positively and significantly related to students’ digital informal learning and computational thinking. In addition, digital informal learning was considered a mediator between networking skills and computational thinking. In conclusion, educators and policymakers should consider the role of digital informal learning alongside networking skills to improve computational thinking skills.

Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (N girl = 52 and N boy = 49; M age = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p <.05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p <.001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

10.1016/j.ecresq.2023.03.004,"• Motivation for computer science sets the stage for learning computational thinking. • There were no gender differences in computer science motivation among children in Grades 1-3. • Children endorsed stereotypes about computer science that favored their own gender. • Individual children's ingroup stereotypes were positively correlated with their own motivation. Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls' motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

,"Contemporary education has been experiencing difficulties because of the fast changing content, especially in the field of Information Technology. In this regard, education institutions have seen an increasing emphasis on the role of computational thinking. Forming Computational Thinking in IT training would help to use fewer efforts and less time to update knowledge and skills in this area after a long period of time – no matter what new technologies, company developed software systems and interface tools have appeared. This article aims to propose an approach to form computational thinking when presenting learning content in order to overcome one of the basic challenges of contemporary IT training – the frequency and high change scales of the studied technologies and tools, which is all a result of high speed of technological advance. The article suggests an invariant framework, which could be used to form computational thinking skills in IT training. The framework allows trainers to formulate skills for pattern recognition, abstraction and focusing on the important information. As a proof for the efficiency of the offered invariant framework for IT knowledge in terms of the discussed problem, part of the learning content related to spreadsheet training has been presented.

10.1002/jee.20372,"Background: Computation and computational thinking are of great interest to both engineering research and teaching communities. Effective learning environments are needed to incorporate computational thinking within the engineering disciplines. Design‐based research is uniquely positioned to address this need for designing effective learning environments. Purpose: This design‐based research study characterizes the different ways in which students used computational thinking when building computational models. The design of the model‐building activities was grounded in productive failure and model‐eliciting activities. Design: The design‐based research study implemented the computational modeling activities within an engineering capstone course. The research question was: What types of computational thinking outcomes emerge when engineering students build computational models? Thematic analysis was applied to individual student artifacts to identify key computational thinking outcomes that were elicited as a result of the intervention. Results: Throughout the building of the model, students demonstrated the use of computational thinking outcomes, mainly abstraction, algorithmic thinking, evaluation, generalization, and decomposition. However, the diversity and density of use for each outcome were different and unique. Conclusions: This study shows how building computational models, when guided by current educational theories, can allow for students to practice the use of computational thinking and for educators to incorporate these key practices into their engineering classrooms.

10.13128/techne-10701,"This study aims to share an educational model experiment for teaching computational thinking with hands-on activities. There is a gap between today’s architectural education system and computational thinking. The exercises aim to fill this gap. In this study, conventional and computational design processes are not considered as two opposing poles, but as integrated processes and as a bridge between these processes. Starting from Gagné’s model, the learning process classification is reinterpreted, and the exercise processes are discussed in the titles of reception, expectancy, computation and semantic encoding, responding and creating alternatives. The outcome of this study will be a discussion on the first results, observations, and feedback from the students about the educational model attempted to be created.

,"This paper presents an analysis of two pairs of fourth graders' exploration of a computational thinking task (related to optimization) within a multimodal paradigm perspective in the Robot Emil context. The data included video recordings of the pupils' work and the analysis was guided by the theoretical lens of the Action, Production and Communication space's semiotic bundle. According to findings, the semiotic bundle regarding solving an optimization task through the Robot Emil context had three major components: verbal signs, tool use, and gestures. Pencil and finger gestures mediated an interpretative link between the tool use and the discourse. Further, they were acting as a strong communication tool when pupils described the trials and the conjectures to each other and also when they evaluated the obtained results. However, we underline that the Robot Emil context does not provide feedback, and therefore the teacher's role is crucial to orchestrate collective classroom discussions in order to compare and consolidate pupils' strategies and optimized solutions.

10.1155/2022/6808562,"Family education relationship is a general term for all the relationships that occur around family education activities. The establishment of family education relationship plays an important role in the activity process and effect of family education and will have a profound impact on children's physical and mental development. The study of family education relationship is an important issue that cannot be ignored in the study of family education theory. In order to enhance the effectiveness of family education, it is an objective requirement of theory and practice to rationally analyze and optimize the contemporary family education relationship from the perspective of communication theory. The introduction of communication theory into the field of family education will help to change the actual situation of lack of communication and barrier in contemporary family education relationship and also provide a new idea and perspective for the research and solution of other related problems in family education. Starting from the research and discussion of the basic theory of the relationship between communication and family education, this paper analyzes the concept and characteristics of family education relationship in detail, analyzes and examines the family education relationship in history, and establishes a basic understanding of family education relationship. On the basis of the research of the relevant basic theories, the paper explores and analyzes the current situation and reasons of the lack of communication and the blocking of the contemporary family education relationship. From the perspective of communication, it investigates the contemporary family-educational relationship, clarifies that the basic structure of the family-educational relationship is the unity of the internal interpersonal organizational relationship structure, the psychological relationship structure, and the activity process structure, and examines the current situation of the basic structure one by one. This paper proposes that, with the development of the times and society, the contemporary family education relationship has a huge development compared with the historical family education relationship, reflecting the characteristics of the times such as democracy, but there is still a lack of communication and barriers. Then it analyzes the various concrete manifestations of the lack of communication and the blocking situation in the contemporary family education relationship and its adverse consequences to family education. This paper verifies the influence of computational thinking on the optimization mechanism of family education and demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of computational thinking in family education. This optimizes the family education mechanism from the perspective of computational thinking and provides a research case with reference value for follow-up research.

10.1155/2022/3575457,"Computational thinking (CT) is an approach that applies the fundamental concepts of computer science to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior, which can help students develop lifetime learning and generate new topics. It has been the elements of competency expected of the next generation of talents. However, the current research on computational thinking evaluation is still at a relatively weak stage. The existing related evaluation research is still limited to traditional curriculum evaluation methods. Therefore, the training effect of computational thinking cannot be well quantified, and the characteristics of students cannot be further explored. In this work, we propose a three-way decision model for improving computation thinking. We first developed a system of evaluation metrics, including five specific primary indicators and several secondary indicators. Next, the weight of each indicator was determined by applying an expert similarity measure, consequently getting the best metric sequence. We employ a grey correlation analysis to calculate the distance of each test result from this optimal sequence. Then, we trisect the set of testers based on the distance to build three regions of high score sequences, medium score sequences, and low score sequences inspired by the three-way decision. We can then exploit these rules on target students in the relatively low regions to improve their computational thinking. An example analysis illustrates the effectiveness and applicability of the method. This article provides a solid theoretical basis for improving students' computational thinking ability. Teaching administrators can conveniently formulate computational thinking teaching strategies, and timely warning and intervention for students with poor computational thinking ability can effectively improve students' computational thinking ability. The corresponding training measures are given to students of different ability levels to achieve differentiated and personalized training.

This competence, inherent to the computer professional, was called Computational Thinking. The term gained relevance from its publication and several works began to be developed.

However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach's alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.

This study presented a research-practice partnership approach to support elementary teachers in a local school district with CT integration. Professional development (PD) followed the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework, and three elementary teachers' PD and classroom implementation experiences were examined and reported as a multiple case study. Interviews, observations, and teacher artifacts and reflections were collected and analyzed. The cross-case analysis revealed that the teachers (1) had an improved understanding of how CS/CT connects with content areas and how to make alignments across content standards, (2) demonstrated concrete strategies for designing and implementing CT-integrated instruction with various coding tools, and (3) provided students with engaging and inclusive learning experiences using a range of pedagogies.

We invited two groups of students (sciences- vs. humanities-oriented members) to participate in a six-stage learning session: to watch a folk-dance illustration (s1) and an animation (s2) of the bubble-sort algorithm; to reconstruct the algorithm on the same input (s3); to orchestrate the algorithm on a random input stored in a white(s4)/black(s5) array (visible/invisible sequence) and to watch a parallel simulation of several sorting algorithms as they work side-by-side on different color-scale bars (s6). To assess the current motivation of students we created nine specific questionnaires (Q1–9). The experiment we conducted included the following task sequence: Q1–2, s1, Q3, s2, Q4, s3, Q5, s4, Q6, s5, Q7, s6, Q8–9. We focused on assessing the motivational contributions of the generated (situational factors) emotions, challenge and active involvement during the e-learning experience. Research results revealed that there are no unbridgeable differences in the way these two groups relate to e-learning processes that aim to promote computational thinking. Although sciences-oriented students' motivational-scores were consistently superior to their humanities-oriented colleagues, there was strong correlation between them; furthermore, differences diminished as both groups advanced with their learning tasks.

10.5753/rbie.2021.2338,"Computational Thinking (CT) is considered one of the most needed abilities of the 21st Century as the usage of digital resources has become more and more frequent. Research on CT teaching has been growing over the last decade and Brazilian initiatives have focused on Elementary and High School students while less privileged audiences, such as non-literate citizens, are rarely addressed. The lack of literacy affects more than communication, but autonomy for economic, cultural and educational development, social interaction, and also the experience with information and communication technology. Non-literate citizens represent more than 11 million people in Brazil, and Youth and Adults Education (YAE) is an educational modality offered to these citizens. In this article, we present the main results from a Master's research that investigated CT as a means to reduce YAE's students' rejection and fear of technology, aware of their characteristics, contexts, and particularities. In our research, we consider that through the practice of CT people can comprehend how technology works and how it can be used, favoring familiarity, and reducing rejection and fear of technology. Grounded on Computing and Education literature, we conceived a model to plan and conduct initiatives for YAE, applying and studying our model in a case study conducted inside a Brazilian public school during 8 workshops with 17 participants. For the case study, 9 principles to support the practice with YAE students were identified and used to inform 12 activities created/adapted for practicing CT throughout the workshops. A research overview is presented, along with its theoretical grounds to the main results from the case study and lessons learned. Results show the model as promising to inform practices to exercise CT abilities, sensitive to the audience's context.

10.5753/RBIE.2021.29.0.880,"This article addresses an interdisciplinary study in which a course on Computational Thinking (CT) was developed in partnership with the Discrete Mathematics (DM) curricular subject to analyze and evaluate the results obtained in the discipline and compare them with those presented from of the CT course intervention, including a control group. The DM is a discipline considered difficult, on the part of the students, because it involves a lot of abstraction and logical reasoning causing a lot of disapproval and low grades. To develop the CT, the andragogical construct proposed in the Cordenonzi doctoral thesis was used. The case study was applied in a binational course - in which students, adults, Brazilians, and Uruguayans, shared the same learning space. Through this research and, based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, it was found that 95.2% of the sample obtained averages above the reference value, 60, which indicates that the development of the CT significantly collaborated in the resolution of problems. As an important contribution presented from this study was the combination of assessment instruments in two interventions that helped the understanding of the concepts addressed in the MD from the PC, as well as the scarce research on the interconnection of mathematics with PC in the context of higher education.

A MD é uma disciplina considerada difícil, por parte dos estudantes, por envolver muita abstração e raciocínio lógico ocasionando muita reprovação e notas baixas. Já para desenvolver o PC foi utilizado o constructo andrológico proposto na tese de doutorado da primeira autora. O estudo de caso foi aplicado em um curso binacional - no qual estudantes, adultos, brasileiros e uruguaios, compartilharam o mesmo espaço de aprendizagem. Por meio desta pesquisa e, a partir da análise, quanti-qualitativa, dos dados, obteve-se que 95,2% da amostra obteve médias acima do valor de referência, 60, o que indica que o desenvolvimento do PC colaborou significativamente na resolução de problemas. Como contribuição importante apresentada a partir deste estudo foi a combinação dos instrumentos de avaliação em duas intervenções que auxiliaram o entendimento dos conceitos abordados na MD a partir do PC, bem como as escassas pesquisas de interligação de matemática com PC no âmbito do ensino superior.

10.5753/RBIE.2021.29.0.604,"Activities that propose the development of Computational Thinking (CT) have been increasingly employed in school environments, and some contributions to the development of cognitive aspects have been reported in literature. Whereas, however, the effort to integrate the CT into Education is not so recent, but has its roots in the early history of Informatics in Education, and whereas pedagogical practices must be thought out and conducted with clear intent, in accordance with and the world view that one has and is aiming for, it is pertinent to reflect on the reasons that justify activities with CT in the school, and what history teaches us about its integration into teaching and learning processes. In this sense, this article aims to promote this reflection from a historical perspective on the trajectory of Informatics in Brazilian Education, seeking to understand the implications of the sociocultural context in each moment, the conceptions of man's relationship with technologies, and the impacts on the way technologies were used in Education, relating to implicit pedagogical trends. For this, a bibliographic and documentary research was carried out. The results indicate that contemporary cybercultural reality encourages and justifies interest in the inclusion of the CT in schools but requires that aspects such as pedagogical conceptions and a balanced view on the role of technologies in Education be considered, teacher training and alignment of CT development activities with curriculum contents.

Integrating CT into different subject areas of K-12 education is also now widely accepted to improve the quality of instruction. In that sense, it is important to enable educators and researchers to recognize how to integrate computational thinking into K-12 classrooms and to study how students learn to think computationally in social studies courses. Besides, providing good practice on CT helps to develop common ground for the teaching of computational thinking in social studies subject areas. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for social studies teachers with regard to how CT can be integrated into K-12 classrooms for social studies. Moreover, a practical implementation idea is also suggested based on this framework. This paper is expected to provide an insight to social studies teachers who want to integrate CT into their classroom in the future and support them in teaching context.

In preparation for its introduction, online resources have been developed for teachers (including junior teachers who teach new entrants, up to Year 3), that contain progress outcomes, lesson plans, exemplars, and assessments. However, it's not clear whether New Zealand junior teachers are sufficiently prepared to teach computational thinking and what factors influence their preparedness to teach the new curriculum. This research explored the experience of a small group of junior school teachers in the year before the technology curriculum was officially introduced. Research findings highlight that factors (including professional development, assessment, schoolwide support, and time availability) influence the uptake of the computational thinking curriculum by teachers in New Zealand junior classrooms.

10.16949/turkbilmat.643709,"Computational thinking has regained attention of academicians, politicians and educators in recent years. Stakeholders with different perspectives have considered how to help students develop computational thinking skills. It is important to measure whether a concept, skill or knowledge has been developed or not. The aim of this study is to adapt the computational thinking test developed in Spanish to Turkish. Firstly, computational thinking test was translated into Turkish and evaluated by experts. Secondly, the test was then translated back to Spanish, and the initial version and the back translated version was compared and then the translation process was completed. Lastly, the Turkish version of computational thinking test was administered to middle school students and evaluated for item difficulty, item discrimination and internal consistency. As a result of these analyzes, the test, which had 28 items in Spanish, was reduced to 24 items. The scores obtained from the test were evaluated in terms of gender and grade level. The test scores did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of gender. There was no significant difference in (i) fifth and sixth grade students and (ii) seventh and eighth grade students in terms of students' computational thinking scores. However, a significant difference was found between these two groups (5-6 and 7-8). Computational thinking test can be used by researchers and educators in their studies and for their teaching.

10.1007/s10799-019-00299-9,"Modern society needs to think of new approaches for solving problems with computing. Computational thinking is the process of abstracting and automating a variety of problems using computational technology. A system that expresses, manages, and processes knowledge such as computational thinking is called a knowledge-based system. This paper proposes to examine students' knowledge about computational thinking when they want to develop a Python project, and the correlation/association between these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from a computer programming lecture. Through this data analysis, we try to identify the factors through the correlation between data and clustering technique in order to express and discover the knowledge about the learner's computational thinking. For the verification of the factors identified, we analyzed the correlation between computational thinking and the pre- and post-test results of the LightBot. In addition to the regression analysis of the proven factors, the probability of the research model was analyzed through the structural equation to process the knowledge discovered. In this paper, we present various problems in the domain of programming education and analyze the means to diagnose and improve knowledge based on computational thinking by finding various problem-solving methods. To pre-examine the learner; he/she was diagnosed using a test paper and the LightBot execution test. We checked the learner's current knowledge state by analyzing the correlation between the test site and the results of the LightBot. To analyze the level of knowledge improvement of learners, we designed an experiment to analyze the correlation between learning and the actual test results through a system that applied the problem-solving learning method. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that there was a correlation between the test results for a learner and the pre-test results of the LightBot. Additionally, the group mean scores of the learners who learned as per the proposed technique were observed to be significant. During this process, we analyzed the effects of problem-solving and system application on academic achievement through factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The ability to pinpoint various problem scenarios and solve problems more effectively using computational technologies will become more important in future. For this purpose, applying our proposed technique for deriving and improving knowledge based on computational thinking to software education will induce the interest of students and increase the learning effect.

The use of a robot in programming education could help students understand computer-science concepts more easily. In this study we designed a course in programming a robot for elementary school students and investigated its effectiveness by implementing it in actual classes. We further examined the effects of students' prior skills and of gender on the outcomes. In addition, we reviewed the applicable teaching and learning strategies in the field of robotics programming. Our course in programming a robot was implemented for 155 Korean elementary school students in the fifth and sixth grades. The course was conducted for 11 weeks. Our results show that teaching programming by using a robot significantly improved computational thinking and creativity. Computational thinking, however, was not significantly improved in the group that initially showed high scores. Further, creativity was improved more in girls than in boys, and the mean difference was statistically significant, but the difference in computational thinking was not. The implication of this study is that the best approach is to design a course in programming a robot and apply it in actual classrooms in order to discuss teaching and learning strategies according to students' prior skills and their gender.

The context is an increasing interest in this field, motivated by a sense that it is important for children to learn computational thinking skills. However, educators struggle with questions regarding what computational thinking in education actually is—and consequently, how they should teach and assess it. In this survey, we wanted to explore existing practices and current situations to find out what school principals regard as important; thus, we designed an electronic questionnaire on this topic. 98 principals started the survey, and 83 completed it. Our analysis suggests that many initiatives connected to computational thinking are currently being implemented, but according to the principals taking part, teachers are not trained to teach this subject. The principals have inclusive views and focus on broad aspects of what computational thinking involves. According to them, computational thinking is not about pushing students into computing careers; rather it is about supporting the well-rounded development of human beings in a free and democratic society. However, the principals do report limited understanding of this subject, which suggests that teachers are not the only ones in need of training—principals also need help to develop a culture and mindset around this subject and implement it efficiently into schools.

10.1007/s11528-019-00410-5,"In the recent years, there has been a push to engage primary and secondary students in computer science to prepare them to live and work in a world influenced by computation. One of the efforts involves getting primary and secondary students to think computationally by introducing computational ideas such as, algorithms and abstraction. Majority of this work around computational thinking has focused on the use of digital technologies, in particular programming environments (Yadav, Stephenson, and Hong 2017). In today's highly digitalized world, we often associate computational problem-solving processes with the use of computers. Yet, solving problems computationally by designing solutions and processing data is not a digital skill, rather a mental skill. Humans have solved problems for eons and before anyone even thought about the types of digital technologies and devices we know today. The purpose of this article is to examine the historical route of computational thinking and how history can inspire and inform initiatives today. We introduce how computational thinking skills are rooted in non-digital (unplugged) human approaches to problem solving, and discuss how mainstream focus changed to digital (plugged) computer approaches, particularly on programming. In addition, we connect past research with current work in computer science education to argue that computational thinking skills and computing principles need to be taught in both unplugged and plugged ways for learners to develop deeper understanding of computational thinking ideas and their relevance in today's society.

The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it aimed to validate a newly developed questionnaire for measuring students’ epistemic beliefs about computer programming at middle school level. Second, the study aimed to understand how students’ epistemic beliefs predict their computational thinking disposition and computer programming self-efficacy. A total of 406 middle school students completed a survey consisting of three research instruments: the Computer Programming Epistemic Belief Inventory (CPEBI), the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), and the Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES). The results indicated that the epistemic belief of “uncertainty” was a significant and positive predictor of the “abstraction” and “generalization” dimensions of computational thinking dispositions. In addition, the belief of “complexity” was an antecedent to three dimensions of computational thinking, namely, “algorithmic thinking,” “evaluation,” and “generalization.” Only the “evaluation” dimension of CT disposition had significant and positive relationships with “programming self-efficacy.” The roles of “uncertainty” and “complexity” of computer programming epistemic beliefs are discussed. Implications and suggestions for future computer programming education, especially for young students, are provided.

10.1007/s11528-019-00461-8,"Problem-solving and critical thinking are considered important skills to be developed by students, and are supported by the development of Computational Thinking (CT) skills. This study investigated the collaborative development of CT skills in sixth grade students via a six week LEGO robotics program. This robotics program focused on the development of four key CT skills: engineering/building, coding, problem-solving, and collaboration. Students in the program maintained journals of their activities, and these journals were analyzed in order to understand the collaborative development of CT skills in these students. Findings suggest that this process is a gendered one, with the boys focused more on the operational aspects of building and coding their robots while the girls focused more on group dynamics. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

The purpose of this interdisciplinary project was to design and develop training, assessments and credentials to help the learners become competent in teaching computational thinking (CT) and coding in developmentally appropriate ways for their students. In accordance with the needs and desires of the stakeholders, the assessments for the project took the form of open badges, and the training consisted of corresponding tutorials to assist individuals earning those badges. The badges, tutorials and some related resources were compiled into the Tech with Kids website (https://iptedtec.wixsite.com/techwithkids) in order to make them accessible for all target learners. Evaluation data suggests, among other findings, that most learners were able to successfully complete badge requirements; that the intervention was effective at helping students improve their understanding of CT; that learners generally perceived the materials as effective; and that the intervention may be implemented in a variety of ways.

10.16949/turkbilmat.385097,"In recent years, developments in the field of computer science, which are in parallel with technology, have led to an increase in the importance of solving problems with the help of computers. It is also worth mentioning that this skill, which is defined as computational thinking, has been an issue about how to be taught and evaluated. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop a self-efficacy perception scale for the computational thinking skill. As a result of the exploratory factor analyzes made, it was seen that the scale includes 39 items with five-factors. Additionally, with confirmatory factor analysis which was carried out for confirmation of the model, 3 items were omitted from the scale and the last structure of the form, with 36 items, was presented. The corrected item-total correlations were ranged between 0.632 and 0.386, whereas the Cronbach Alpha coefficients were between 0.762 and 0.930. Also, t-tests for the item average means of the bottom and top 27% of the groups were presented significant differences between those groups.

10.1080/10494820.2023.2223239,"The game-based learning approach to developing students’ computational thinking (CT) current has received attention from researchers. However, the compatibility between games and instruction is often insufficient to accommodate the entertaining and educational nature of the curriculum entirely, and the benefits of game-based learning could be compromised. Therefore, this study proposed a role-playing-based micro-game strategy for developing students’ CT in a Python programming course, and designed a quasi-experiment to verify the effectiveness of the role-playing-based micro-game strategy. A total of 133 eighth-grade students from schools in eastern China were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used a role-playing-based micro-game strategy, and the control group used a traditional instructional strategy. The results showed that the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group on the CT test, especially in the dimensions of computational concepts and computational practices. The learning engagement of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and the learning motivation of the experimental group was significantly improved before and after the experiment. In addition, qualitative analysis of the interview data indicated that micro-game strategy on role-playing could promote classroom learning and meet the needs of the course knowledge system.

Computational thinking (CT) education is one pathway helping young students to thrive in the digital world. CT is a critical reasoning process whereby people formulate and solve problems using computers. CT education relies not only on schools and teachers, but also on parents. We reviewed 34 studies of the influence of parents on their children’s CT education. We explore the following four aspects in CT education: (1) the contexts, (2) the effects regarding participation (affective, behavioral, and cognitive) outcomes in CT education, (3) the research designs, and (4) the mechanisms through which parents’ participation influences children’s CT education. Two theoretical frameworks, the tripartite model and parental involvement theory, were used to synthesize the 34 articles to analyze parents’ affective, behavioral, and cognitive participation outcomes as well as the mechanisms of parental influence on CT education. We propose a conceptual framework of parental involvement in CT education. We further provide recommendations for supporting parents’ involvement in children’s CT education by suggesting appropriate parental mindsets and strategies to maximize the effectiveness of children’s CT education.

Through a series of regression analyses, we identified the associations between the three variables and found support for existing theories in the CT preservice education context. Notably, we found that CT usage and CT UV were only associated through the mediation of self-efficacy, which seems to be the key component for usage. We propose that CT focused interventions targeting utility value and classroom practices and policies should be provided to give preservice teachers experience in using CT software/tools are key for teacher education institutions and CT implementation into curricula.

,"This work in progress paper analyzes disciplinary teachers' self-efficacy beliefs in Computational Thinking (CT) during a professional development program on (CT). The increasing number of professional development programs to promote the integration of CT into the curricula brings the challenge of understanding how to effectively assess them. The research team designed, implemented, and assessed a 20-hour professional development program to incorporate computational practices into disciplinary learning environments at the K-12 level in Colombia. In total, 101 in-service teachers from Colombian public middle and high schools participated in this program. We used the learning progression use-modify-create as the pedagogical framework to scaffold participants' learning process. The participating teachers completed a pretest and a post-test regarding their experience in the program, their self-efficacy beliefs in CT, and their understanding of CT concepts. As a final project of the program, the participating teachers presented a lesson plan to integrate computational thinking skills into their disciplinary courses. This lesson plan was assessed using a rubric including criteria such as the context, the learning outcomes, the assessment strategy, the pedagogical strategies, and the alignment among these components.

To achieve this, tests were conducted with different groups of students with which some quantitative and qualitative results were obtained that allowed some inferences to be made not only in terms of effectiveness but also in terms of the effect on learning of a parametric methodology such as IPO (input - process - output) that allows, simply to have elements of judgment to know where to start the process of solving a problem, how to proceed with this start and to arrive at a response that solves the problem statement. The results conclude that while the students have a parametric methodology to solve sentences, problems, situations and exercises, it will be much easier to solve problems and, in addition, they will be able to appropriate the computational thinking, so necessary in times in which new technologies we can find in all corners of society and their needs.

10.5753/RBIE.2019.27.02.01,"The teaching of computational thinking to children has become an increasingly important activity in recent years, especially in Europe and in the United States. In Brazil, the Brazilian Society of Computing (SBC) recommends that computational reasoning skills should be developed in the early stages of education. The contact with computational thinking concepts provides experiences that can encourage children to develop different abilities, such as logical reasoning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, decomposition and generalization. This article presents a methodology, called MEPeCoC, that aims to support the teaching of computational thinking to children. Alternating between unplugged and plugged activities and complementing them with the development of a project, MEPeCoC aims to introduce the fundamentals of CT skills in a synergic and incremental way. The proposal was evaluated in a case study with the participation of elementary school students from a public school in Sorocaba - SP. The results demonstrated that the elements that composed the methodology bring a great potential to aid the teaching of computational thinking.

10.5753/RBIE.2019.27.02.167,"This paper presents a case study about the development of Computational Thinking in primary school children (3st to 4th grade) via the teaching of programming abilities with the use of educational robotics, free technology and recyclable, low cost materials. We aimed at raising some hypotheses on whether there is a straight relationship between some cognitive aspects of children aged 8-10 (such as the ability to put events and ideas in sequence, the ability to execute mental operations on the basis of concrete experience, among others) and the ability to execute activities that may be linked to the learning of computer programming. The observed results indicated (from the use of a didactic kit developed for the accomplishment of this study) the possibility to develop the following computational thinking skills: abstract thinking ability, understanding of flows of control, Debugging and systematic error detection, iterative thinking, use of conditional logic and problem decomposition. Regarding the investigations related to cognitive maturity, we found evidence of a correlation between the cognitive characteristics analyzed and the performance of certain tasks related to computer programming, such as the development of purely sequential programs and understanding of processing idea.

Busca-se também levantar hipóteses acerca da existência de uma relação direta entre certas características cognitivas de crianças com idade entre 8 e 10 anos (tais como a habilidade de sequenciar eventos ou ideias, a habilidade de realizar operações mentais a partir de experiências concretas, dentre outras) e a habilidade para realizar determinadas atividades relacionadas ao aprendizado de programação de computadores. Os resultados observados indicam (a partir do uso de um kit didático desenvolvido para a realização deste estudo) a possibilidade de desenvolvimento das seguintes habilidades do Pensamento Computacional: capacidade de abstração, compreensão de fluxos de controle, depuração e detecção sistemática de erros, pensamento iterativo, uso da lógica condicional e decomposição de problemas. No tocante às investigações relacionadas à maturidade cognitiva, foram encontrados indícios da existência de uma relação direta entre as características cognitivas analisadas e a realização de determinadas tarefas ligadas à programação de computadores, como o desenvolvimento de programas puramente sequenciais e a compreensão da ideia de processamento.

10.5753/RBIE.2019.27.02.140,"The new paradigms of interactions have arisen over the years and motivated the investigation of their potential for use within teaching-learning context. In a natural user interface (NUI), the interaction comes naturally while users interact with an application by using gestures, voice, touch, and so on. These ways of interaction are called natural, so they are based on body actions and movements commonly adopted by users in their daily life. Recently, the teaching of computational thinking in the early stages of children education has been highly discussed by education professionals and researchers in informatics and education in Brazil. And most of them recognize that games are a means to encourage children to develop the computational thinking. Taking into account that NUI can be adopted by applications with learning purposes, this article explores the potential of using such ways of interaction in a game for teaching computational thinking to children. The study was conducted in three stages. First, 10 children were co-participants in the selection of gestures and images of the game. In the second stage, considering the results of the first stage, two versions of the game were developed; one allowing the interactions by gestures and another by touch. Finally, an investigation was carried out on the acceptance and use of the two versions of the game, with 49 children. All children that took part in the study belonged to primary schools in Brazil. The results showed that by using the gestures to interact the children become more focused and more conscious about the movements they were performing in contrast to when they interacted by touch. In addition, a high level of acceptance for both ways of interaction was reported by the participants by which we could conclude that they had no difficulties in understanding the gestures and images. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Os novos paradigmas de interações têm surgido ao longo dos anos e motivam a investigação do seu potencial de uso no contexto do ensino-aprendizagem. Em uma interface de usuário natural (NUI - Natural User Interface), a interação ocorre naturalmente enquanto os usuários interagem com uma aplicação usando gestos, voz, toque e assim por diante. Essas formas de interação são chamadas de naturais, pois são baseadas em ações corporais e movimentos comumente adotados pelos usuários em sua vida diária. Recentemente, o ensino do pensamento computacional nos estágios iniciais da educação fundamental I tem sido amplamente discutido por profissionais da educação e pesquisadores em informática e educação no Brasil. E a maioria deles reconhece que os jogos são um meio para encorajar as crianças a desenvolverem o pensamento computacional. Considerando que a NUI pode ser adotada por aplicativos com fins de aprendizagem, este artigo explora o potencial de usar essas formas de interação em um jogo para ensinar o pensamento computacional para crianças. O estudo foi realizado em três etapas. Primeiro, 10 crianças foram coparticipantes na seleção de gestos e imagens do jogo. Na segunda etapa, considerando os resultados da primeira, foram desenvolvidas duas versões do jogo; uma permitindo as interações por gestos e outro por toque. Finalmente, foi realizada uma investigação sobre a aceitação e uso das duas versões do jogo, com 49 crianças. Todas as crianças que participaram do estudo pertenciam a escolas primárias no Brasil. Os resultados mostraram que, usando os gestos para interagir, as crianças se tornam mais focadas e mais conscientes dos movimentos que estavam realizando do que quando usavam a interação através do toque. Além disso, um alto nível de aceitação para ambos os modos de interação foi relatado pelos participantes em uma demonstração de que não tiveram dificuldades em entender os gestos e imagens.

10.1080/15305058.2018.1543311,"Computational thinking is a core skill in computer science that has become a focus of instruction in primary and secondary education worldwide. Since 2010, researchers have leveraged Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) methods to develop measures of students' Computational Thinking (CT) practices. This article describes how ECD was used to develop CT assessments for primary students in Hong Kong and secondary students in the United States. We demonstrate how leveraging ECD yields a principled design for developing assessments of hard-to-assess constructs and, as part of the process, creates reusable artifacts—design patterns and task templates—that inform the design of other, related assessments. Leveraging ECD, as described in this article, represents a principled approach to measuring students' computational thinking practices, and situates the approach in emerging computational thinking curricula and programs to emphasize the links between curricula and assessment design.

,"Nowadays, computational thinking (CT) and creativity are concerned as core competences in the 21st century for everyone who wants to take a career and work in the ever-evolving digital society. This study presents a systematic literature review (2006-2018) aiming to highlight teaching practices and learning frameworks used to support the development of both computational and creative thinking skills of primary level education students. Over the last years, there is a trend for these competences to be conceived as complementary and synergetic abilities and approaches which should be delivered and promoted together in order to train students to be problem solvers and critical thinkers, by understanding and using the digital technology provided creatively. Since only four solid empirical studies have been found relevant to K-6 education, the efforts made to combine these two thinking skills into teaching practice are still in infancy. The learning frameworks involved students mainly in game programming activities, as well as in programming activities related to art education where students should make use of technological resources, sensor cards and minicomputers. Limitations and recommendations for future research are also provided.

10.1007/s11528-018-0290-9,"Computational thinking is one of the skills critical for successfully solving problems posed in a technology driven and complex society. The limited opportunities in school settings to help students develop computational thinking skills underscores the need for helping teachers integrate it in their practices. Besides developing the knowledge of technology, content, and pedagogy, teachers need to recognize the relevance of computational thinking to their teaching, a factor influencing their future practice with it. Drawing from the literature on problem-solving and TPACK framework, this paper discusses strategies, including content-specific examples, problem-solving nature of computational thinking, and the methods of teaching problem-solving for enabling teachers to make the connections between computational thinking and their practices.

10.1080/08957347.2020.1835912,"We describe the use of think alouds to examine substantive processes involved in performance on a formative assessment of computational thinking (CT) designed to support self-regulated learning (SRL). Our task design model included three phases of work on a computational thinking problem: forethought, performance, and reflection. The cognitive processes of seven students who reported their thinking during all three phases were analyzed. Ratings of artifacts of code indicated the computational thinking problem was moderately difficult to solve (M = 15, SD = 5) on a scale of 0 to 21 points. Profiles were created to illustrate length and sequence of different types of cognitive processes during the think-aloud. Results provide construct validity evidence for the tasks as formative assessments of CT, elucidate the way learners at different levels of skill use SRL, shed light on the nature of computational thinking, and point out areas for improvement in assessment design.

Game-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning are two approaches that may aid in the development of CT skills. This paper describes a framework based on Game and Problem-Based Learning Strategies which aims to enhance the CT teaching and improves students' social skills, considering aspects of fun. The framework stands out for including collaborative learning features defined in the main literature. Also, the strategy was developed specifically to fit the games' dynamics.

10.1057/s41286-023-00170-x,"What happens when intuition becomes algorithmic? This article explores how approaching intuition as recursively trained sheds light on what is at stake affectively, politically, and ethically in the entanglements of sensorial, cognitive, computational and corporate processes and (infra)structures that characterise algorithmic life. Bringing affect theory and speculative philosophies to bear on computational histories and cultures, I tease out the continuing implications of post-war efforts to make intuition a measurable and indexable mode of anticipatory knowledge. If digital computing pioneers tended to elide the more ambivalent implications of quantifying intuition, this article asks what computational myths are at play in current accounts of machine learning-enabled sensing, thinking, and speculating and what complexities or chaos are disavowed. I argue that an understanding of more-than-human intuition which grapples meaningfully with the indeterminacy central to digitally mediated social life must recognise that visceral response is recursively trained in multiple ways with diverse, and often contradictory, effects.

In this paper, the representative CT educational policy initiatives viewed through the lens of international perspectives and cultural contexts were examined, compared and discussed. Reports, white papers, and policy documents were widely explored, selected through established criteria, and eventually analyzed by the research team. It was found that CTEPI has two characteristics—diverse CT terminology and diverse current status across the globe. Also, curriculum reform and enrichment programs represented two major approaches for CTEPI across the globe. Finally, four development trends emerged from an analysis of CT education policies and initiatives: collaboration and partnerships across sectors and national boundaries, rationales taking a broad perspective and referring to common themes, a redefinition of digital competence, and an emphasis on broadening access and interest.

However, there has been a lack of knowledge of how pre-service K-8 teachers would be engaged in the learning of CT and its integration in different subject areas. In this study, we taught a flipped learning module in an undergraduate Educational Technology course. Pre-service teachers learned and practiced CT knowledge and skills using a block programming app called Hopscotch. Results of this first iteration of design-based research showed that the orchestration of the technology and instructional methods, such as team-based learning, flipped classroom, and pair programming, supported students' transformative learning experience. It improved their understanding and application of CT concepts. Meanwhile, the mixed-method analysis found some instructional issues that needed to be addressed in future iterations.

,"In ""The Future of Jobs Report 2020"", the world economic forum (WEF) built a list of ten skills that will be most required in jobs by 2025, one of them being ""technology design and programming"". In response to the above, in recent years, many projects have been launched to increase programming knowledge for different audiences and in different parts of the world. One of these projects was developed through a collaboration between a university in Colombia and a worldwide company from the technology industry. The purpose of the project was to teach programming skills to the underserved population in Colombia. For this, different programming languages were taught, one of them was the visual programming language Scratch®, in conjunction with a hardware platform to help students understand the interaction between hardware and software. The hardware platform provided for the project had some limitations, like not working with the last version of Scratch®; research for other platforms showed that few existed, some were too expensive, or were no longer available on the market. These problems led the authors of this article to design and develop a new platform that interacts with the latest version of Scratch® and included more sensors and actuators that help students to develop their computational thinking. For the conception, design, and implementation of the hardware platform, we followed a topdown methodology, starting from a high-level idea, and increasing the detail of each module until reaching a minimum viable product that was tested following a predefined test protocol. We used Finite States Machine as a theory of computation to model the behavior of the platform and to develop the embedded code. To secure the operation of the platform, we added new blocks to the source code of the latest version of Scratch®, this was a difficult challenge because it implied modifying complex programming sources, for this, a structured design strategy was followed. Finally, a function-oriented design was used to develop a software bridge in Python to assure communication between the above two components. This project resulted in three main components being developed and fully tested. First a shield for an Arduino Uno board, with sensors and actuators compatible with Scratch's functions, second a standalone modified version of Scratch, that can run from a free access webpage or can be downloaded to run locally, and finally a software bridge that allows the communication between the hardware and the software. The resulting solution works properly with Scratch® codes that use the built-in blocks as well as the ones developed in the project. The project attained its objectives and made a contribution to the development of educational tools for teaching computational thinking. The entire solution will be used in summer camp training to teach programming skills to a young audience in Colombia. New projects have derived from the results, like the development of instructional guides for practices that use the solution, and the development of enhanced versions that can reduce the costs of production and introduce wireless communication.

,"In this paper, we seek to investigate the ways and circumstances in which undergraduate engineering students engage in computational thinking (CT). As technology advances, we move towards a new industrial landscape where engineers face increasingly complex problems. For engineering students of the 21st century to thrive in their future careers, it is crucial for interdisciplinary education to equip them with the necessary tools and support required to solve problems effectively and think more comprehensively. CT and the engineering way of thinking enhance conceptualization and critical thinking skills, and their processes complement each other. Thus, promoting CT in engineering education is essential. However, research on the interpretation and development of CT is conducted to a limited extent at the undergraduate level. A semi-structured interview protocol was developed to gather insights on the five main pillars of computational thinking practices (i.e., abstraction, algorithms, problem decomposition, pattern recognition, troubleshooting/debugging) from eight undergraduate students (four female and four male). The participants were evenly distributed across four disciplines, including computer science, electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering, and computer engineering, in a Southeast Asian research-focused institution. The students discussed their perceptions of CT within their respective disciplines and provided examples of when they thought CT might be helpful. Using thematic analysis, the results are used to understand how CT competencies organically arise in students' problem-solving processes. Student responses suggested that incorporating more use cases in the structuring of coursework may facilitate the integration of CT into the engineering curriculum by improving the recognition of CT concepts.

,"Computational thinking has widely been recognized as a crucial skill for engineers engaged in problem-solving. Multidisciplinary learning environments such as integrated STEM courses are powerful spaces where computational thinking skills can be cultivated. However, it is not clear the best ways to integrate computational thinking instruction or how students develop computational thinking in those spaces. Thus, we wonder: To what extent does engaging students in integrated engineering design and physics labs impact their development of computational thinking? We have incorporated engineering design within a traditional introductory calculusbased physics lab to promote students' conceptual understanding of physics while fostering scientific inquiry, mathematical modeling, engineering design, and computational thinking. Using a generic qualitative research approach, we explored the development of computational thinking for six teams when completing an engineering design challenge to propose an algorithm to remotely control an autonomous guided vehicle throughout a warehouse. Across five consecutive lab sessions, teams represented their algorithms using a flowchart, completing four iterations of their initial flowchart. 24 flowcharts were open coded for evidence of four computational thinking facets: decomposition, abstraction, algorithms, and debugging. Our results suggest that students' initial flowcharts focused on decomposing the problem and abstracting aspects that teams initially found to be more relevant. After each iteration, teams refined their flowcharts using pattern recognition, algorithm design, efficiency, and debugging. The teams would benefit from having more feedback about their understanding of the problem, the relevant physics concepts, and the logic and efficiency of the flowcharts.

,"This NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET) ""Research Experience for Teachers in Big Data and Data Science"" (award number: 1801513) engaged four middle/high school science teachers in summer 2022 with research related to big data and data science, with follow-up school year implementation of related curricula. These teachers developed curricula related to their summer research experience in big data and data science that spanned a range of student ages and topics: middle school science, 9th grade biology, 9th grade health, and 11th grade chemistry. Despite the wide range of student ages, curricular content, and instructional goals, all teachers found rich and varied curriculum applications related to data science and AI that fit within their existing curriculum constraints. In particular, teachers found that the Next Generation Science Standards [1] practice of ""computational thinking"" was the best lens for developing their aligned big data instruction. After exploring a taxonomy of computational thinking in mathematics and science [2], the teachers collectively eventually settled on a core set of four computational thinking skills [3] most likely to be productive for their teaching focus; algorithmic thinking, decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition. This paper reports on the variety of connections teachers developed with the practice of computational thinking, from data clustering as an active practice for simulating early generation of the periodic table in a chemistry class, to sampling/resampling populations in outdoor aquatic environments, to programming in middle school science, to adapting explainable AI for analyzing studentgenerated data in a health education class. Teacher reports of their own learning about research in data science, and how they were able to adapt that learning for the benefit of their middle/high school students, will capture the flexibility and value that this experience provided.

10.3390/en17153806,"Oil refineries play a crucial role in meeting global energy demands, and optimizing the efficiency of critical processes is vital for economic feasibility and environmental sustainability. Simulation is an essential tool for the optimization of valuable products. This work presents the rigorous simulation of a vacuum distillation unit (VDU) based on actual data from the vacuum distillation processes using Aspen HYSYS V10. The Peng–Robinson fluid package is used in this simulation, and an input assay with a standard density of 29 API_60 (879.8 kg/m3) is employed. True boiling point (TBP) assay data are the type that is being used. Methane, ethane, propane, i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane are the components listed in the simulation. The research determines that achieving a yield capacity of 685 tons/h requires thirty stages in the atmospheric distillation unit and twelve stages in the vacuum distillation unit while operating at 420 °C temperature and 9 kPa pressure. Adjustments in the flash section temperature (FST) and steam flow rate (SFR) are proposed to enhance operational efficiency. Increasing the FST from 370 °C to 400 °C and adjusting SFR from 10 tons/h to 26 tons/h increases the Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO) yield by 7.2% while elevating the FST from 400 °C to 430 °C and adjusting SFR from 10 tons/h to 26 tons/h enhances the High Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO) yield by 7.4%. These optimization strategies offer a practical and effective approach for refineries to improve the economic benefits of vacuum distillation units. The implications of this research can act as a computational thinking exercise for higher education students considering the case study where only through changing the operational strategies can the yield be enhanced by 10.81% in the vacuum distillation unit of the oil refinery.

10.1111/jcal.12723,"Background: Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as an essential 21st‐century skill, and attempts have been made to integrate it into other subjects. Instructional approaches to CT development and assessment in the field of computer science have attracted global attention, but the influence of CT skills on other subject areas is under‐researched. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the transfer effects of CT in different subject areas and examine the educational characteristics of CT intervention approaches that promote the transfer of learning. Method: We carefully selected and reviewed 55 empirical studies from leading bibliographic databases and examined the transfer of CT using a meta‐analysis and a qualitative synthesis. Results and Conclusions: We identified and summarized these effects in the fields of mathematics, science, engineering and the humanities. A meta‐analysis of these studies identified a generally significant effect of the transfer of CT skills to other subject areas. We also explored the characteristics of CT interventions that aid the transfer of learning by qualitatively assessing the identified studies. The results of the review offer a holistic view of the trends in CT transfer research that can be used as a reference for both researchers and instructors. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) has been developed into cross‐disciplinary literacy and can lead to innovations in various academic fields.There is a need for a systematic understanding of the transfer effects of CT to improve the influence of CT and promote CT integration across domains. What this paper adds: Our review identified several subject areas beyond computer science in which the transfer effects of CT were observed.Our analysis revealed that the transfer of CT has a significant positive effect on students' learning in areas beyond computer science.Our review synthesized a series of intervention guidelines that can promote the transfer of learning in CT education. Implications for practitioners: Research on the transfer of CT in engineering and non‐STEM domains is required for a more comprehensive understanding of CT skills.Instructional design in CT education should attend to the facilitation of the transfer of learning to maximize the benefits of CT acquisition.

10.1080/18117295.2022.2133739,"Although there is a lot of interest in the development of computational thinking (CT) and the benefits it could have for every student, integrating it into science classrooms may be more difficult than traditional teaching. This can be very challenging for South African science teachers. Thus, there is an increasing need to prepare teachers and systematically engage them in professional development activities to help them learn, unlearn, relearn and restructure their thoughts, perceptions and attitudes towards integrating CT in science classrooms. This study explored teachers' perceptions and concerns about integrating CT in science teaching. Twenty-two science teachers from innercity secondary schools in South Africa were chosen to be part of this exploratory case study. Data were collected through take-home assignments and focus group discussions containing a series of open-ended questions. The concern-based adoption model was used as a lens to understand teachers' stages of concern. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. It was found that sampled science teachers viewed CT as a valuable tool that can help promote learners' data management practices and problem-solving practices, especially in reducing complex problems to researchable problems. The findings also showed that teachers intend to integrate CT into their science classrooms by refining their existing practices. However, teachers showed high informational, personal and management-related concerns regarding integrating CT in South African science classrooms: they needed more practical and contextual ideas on strategically integrating CT in their daily lessons. Conversely, teachers showed limited concern at the unrelated, consequence, collaboration and refocusing stage. This suggests a need for teacher education programmes in South Africa to focus more acutely on training pre-service teachers on how to plan and design science instruction using computational thinking concepts and practices.

10.1109/TE.2022.3159765,"Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.

10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105045,"In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a '21St Century' competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education. • Original study using structured curriculum to teach very young students' computational thinking (CT) concepts and practices. • Considerable evidence was found indicating development of basic and more advanced CT concepts and practices. • Structured curricula should be (re)considered as an effective approach for teaching young students CT concepts and practices. • The early development of CT concepts and practices should be integral to contemporary digital literacy.

10.1007/s11423-024-10400-x,"Computational thinking is acknowledged as an essential competency for everyone to learn. However, teachers find it challenging to implement the existing learning approaches in K-12 settings because the existing approaches often focus on teaching computing concepts and skills (i.e., programming skills) rather than on helping students develop their computational thinking competency—a competency that can be used across disciplinary boundaries in accordance with curriculum requirements. To address this need, the current study investigated how game-based learning influenced middle school students’ learning processes, particularly on the development of computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking, and engagement during gameplay. Additionally, the study examined how these outcomes were moderated by individual differences. We observed evidence that the gaming experience influenced students’ computational thinking self-efficacy, but not computational thinking competency or game-based engagement. Compared to age (grade) and prior gaming experience, gender tended to play a more important role in moderating students’ computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking competency, and game-based engagement. Implications and possible directions for future research regarding using game-based learning to enhance computational thinking competency are discussed.

10.1007/s11423-024-10397-3,"A majority of research in Computational Thinking (CT) mainly focuses on teaching coding to school students. However, CT involves more than just coding and includes other skills like algorithmic thinking. The current study developed an Online Inquiry-based Learning Platform for Computational Thinking (CT-ONLINQ) that follows Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) pedagogy to support CT activities. IBL-based CT steps include algorithm design, analysis, and comparison of algorithms. Also, the platform allows students to explore multiple solutions to a problem and provides multiple-try feedback with hints as support during problem-solving activities. The hint generation strategy uses a Knowledge Graph that captures knowledge about the problem's solution in a machine-processible form. A six-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of multiple-try feedback with hints on students’ CT skills. The study included 79 high school students: 41 students as part of the experimental group (EG) were provided problem-specific hints, and 38 as part of the control group (CG) with CT-general hints. The results showed that the students in the EG group improved their CT skills significantly more than those in the CG group. In addition, the study also evaluates the effectiveness of intervention considering biases in gender and prior coding experience. Female students performed better than male students in both groups after the intervention. Furthermore, in EG group, observations showed that students without coding experience performed better than their counterparts with experience. The findings suggest that the IBL-based CT activity on CT-ONLINQ can be deployed to improve the CT skills of school students.

10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105039,"In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children. • A metaphor-based robot programming approach was proposed. • The approach aimed to facilitate young children's computational thinking. • An experiment was conducted in a kindergarten. • The approach improved young children's computational thinking. • The approach improved young children's positive learning behaviors.

Thus, this article's goal is to rethink the computational thinking framework and overcome its limitations considering the cultural context and especially the rescue of cultural identity. To do this we will follow three main lines of thought: a) the discussion of the limits of technocentrism; b) a proper analysis of the characteristics of software; c) the analysis of alternative educational solutions like Turing machines and shape grammars.

10.1111/bjet.12898,"Although there is wide rhetoric that programming should be learnt by all as an element of computational thinking (CT), in practice, it is mostly implemented narrowly as an end in itself consisting of routine practice and traditional testing of the ability to code. This paper discusses a way in which programming could be seen through a wider integrated pedagogical approach as jointly cultivating meaning making of computational concepts in conjunction with the adoption of practices and strategies in a relevant meaningful context for learners. We elaborate on a case of learning to code through digital game modding where programming and other computational concepts coexist. Our design frame includes the principles of black and white box designs, of students as de‐buggers of engineered half‐baked games and of games embedding both concepts and values in simulations involving wider contested complex issues. We use our analysis of the meaning making of students as they debug a choice‐driven simulation game specially designed to bring this integrated kind of learning to the fore. We show elements of context‐aware integrated CT connecting otherwise fragmented areas such as databases, block‐based programming, Geographical Information Systems design.

10.1080/09500693.2022.2160221,"The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the integration of computational thinking with learning about biological evolution. Specifically, we investigated the effectiveness of a framework from a recently developed learning progression that emphasises the complex nature of teaching both computational thinking and biological evolution. Computational thinking is a concept introduced by relatively recent science education reform efforts. For many educators, the notion of computational thinking is unclear making it difficult to integrate into instruction. High school student participants engaged in a quasi-experimental design study. Interventions integrating computational thinking and evolution concepts were used synonymously with assessments to identify change in both student biological evolution knowledge and computational knowledge over time. Students deepened their knowledge in both areas; however, one intervention was more robust in increasing both knowledge of computational thinking and biological evolution. The results warrant future research in these areas and suggest that computational thinking deserves a much greater emphasis within biology classrooms. It also supports the learning progression's model of weaving disciplinary core ideas with scientific practices to deepen students' science learning.

10.1093/iwc/iwac028,"Computational thinking is an ability that has been considered essential for people living in a society mediated by technology. This ability can also be helpful to people with little or no experience with technology, for practicing basic Computational Thinking skills may help understanding how a technological device works and can be used. However, to the best of our knowledge, little research has addressed Computational Thinking and its relation with Digital Culture, especially for reducing the digital divide. In this article, we draw on the notion of Mental Models to relate Computational Thinking and Digital Culture. We claim that practicing basic Computational Thinking skills when exploring simple prototypes favors building Mental Models that are useful to understand and progress in the usage of technologies, contributing to developing a Digital Culture. To situate our discussion, we present a case study that engaged adults, in their initial stages of literacy, in activities that grew from basic ones, with a low-fidelity ATM prototype, to more complex ones with a functional ATM prototype. Evaluation methods used were voting, feedback, structured observation and unstructured interviews. Results suggested our approach is promising as participants gained confidence and increased autonomy as the activities progressed, using the experience and knowledge they obtained from previous activities to perform the next ones.

10.1007/s11528-024-00993-8,"This study investigated the computational thinking (CT) practices of eight pre-service teachers through their Scratch and Python programs. Conducted within an undergraduate-level computer science education course, students learned CT concepts via parallel instruction in block-based programming (Scratch) and text-based programming (Python). The research focused on the synergistic effects of this parallel instruction, investigating how novices’ CT practice evolved while encountering unique features of each environment. Findings indicated that students’ CT practices in one programming environment positively influenced their practices in the other, particularly where syntactic similarities existed. Overall, their strategies for controlling program flow progressed from time-based controls to message-passing controls, and finally to condition-based controls. However, the students demonstrated a lack of abstracting and modularizing skills in their computational problem-solving across both programming environments.

10.1007/s10643-024-01728-3,"The domain of early childhood education has witnessed an increasing emphasis on developing coding and computational thinking (CT) abilities. Scholarly investigations have delved into appropriate approaches for enhancing these proficiencies within early childhood classrooms. The present study aims to investigate the impact of a digital story design program, or Design-Based Digital Story Program (DBDS), on the coding and CT skills of 5-year-old children. Specifically designed for children aged 3–6, the DBDS program aligns with constructivism principles, which promote experiential learning. Employing a case–control quasi-experimental design, the study employed pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments and a follow-up retest after one month. The intervention involved implementing the digital story design program over 11 weeks, with three sessions per week, each lasting between 60 to 90 min, targeting five-year-old participants. The findings reveal that the DBDS program significantly enhances CT and coding skills compared to a control group. Moreover, female participants exhibited more significant improvements in CT skills post-intervention than their male counterparts, while no significant gender-based effects were observed in coding skills. These findings suggest that the DBDS program effectively supports the cultivation of coding and CT abilities among young children, warranting further exploration in diverse educational settings and across various grade levels.

10.1007/s13384-024-00762-9,"The importance of incorporating digital technologies into early childhood education is now widely accepted to help position children as creative producers and not just consumers of technology. Early childhood educators in turn have a key role to play in developing technology-related skills and competencies such as coding and computational thinking (CT). In response, internationally a range of tangible coding technologies (TCTs), or digital toys, have been created to foster the development of young children’s coding and CT skills. However, to what extent are children’s developing skills and knowledge encouraged by the design of the TCT itself, and the educators’ pedagogy? This article reports on a study into the impact of one TCT, <italic>Cubetto</italic>, on the CT of a group of young children in an Early Years Learning Centre in Australia, and how educators encouraged coding and CT using <italic>Cubetto</italic>. The study revealed that <italic>Cubetto</italic> not only promoted children’s understanding of the nature of digital technologies but encouraged CT skills such as sequencing, cause-and-effect, and foundational numeracy in a collaborative, constructivist way. This was mediated in turn by the educators’ ability to utilise <italic>Cubetto</italic> effectively in an inquiry-based STEM learning context. Accordingly, this study notes that the incorporation of TCTs can be beneficial but need careful consideration as to their educational purpose and should be supported by developmentally appropriate pedagogical practices to maximise their potential in developing coding skills and CT in young children.

10.17398/1695-288X.17.2.129,"Programming is being included in educational curricula around the world to develop computational thinking. However, there is no consensus on what processes this thought implies, nor on how to intervene and evaluate its development. Therefore, the objective is to propose a teaching strategy for programming and robotics, which really develops this thinking and can be applied to solve problems, from a maker perspective that facilitates the transfer of knowledge to real contexts. To this end, a robotics course has been taught, insisting on the cognitive processes of this thinking that are commonly used in problem solving (abstraction, data processing, creation of an algorithm), and encouraging the use of a computational strategy, using the processes of this thought not employed in problem solving (decomposition of the problem, automation, parallelism, simulation). To measure it, digital tests have been created based on the multiple complex-systems approach, used in PISA 2012. The results indicate that computational thinking is applied more easily to the execution of the algorithm than to the representation of the problem. This finding allows us to establish a programming learning process that facilitates the development of computational thinking, to solve any problem by applying a computational strategy: focusing first on applying this strategy to the creation of the algorithm and then to the representation of the problem.

10.1007/s11528-017-0248-3,"In this paper, we propose that paper circuitry provides a productive space for exploring aspects of computational thinking, an increasingly critical 21st century skills for all students. We argue that the creation and operation of paper circuits involve learning about computational concepts such as rule-based constraints, operations, and defined states. Moreover, paper circuitry materials are low cost, provide a low threshold to entry, and draw upon the familiarity that already exists with respect to paper as a hands-on and interactive medium. Paper circuitry thus provides multiple points of entry for students who are unfamiliar with computational thinking ideas while also supporting creative, artistic and crafting activities. It also provides an important alternative to the typically steep learning curve associated with learning a programming language. We define paper circuitry and associated technologies, show how they afford key dimensions of computational thinking, and present examples of paper circuit projects created by students.

The quasi experimental study with a pretest-posttest control group design was carried out with 62 (31assigned to Experimental and assigned to Control group respectively) 5th grader students. The study was conducted in a 6-week period during information technologies and software classes. The experimental group students were taught algorithms by using the Scratch program while control group students learned algorithms with the help of the current curriculum. Students were administered Computational Thinking Scale and Algorithm Development Achievement Test as pre and post-tests. The required factor and reliability analyses were carried out for computational thinking scale and Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.809. KR-20 internal consistency coefficient for Algorithm Development Achievement Test was found to be 0.85. Independent Samples t test was administered to see whether there was a statistically significant difference between the groups' achievement test results. Results show that experimental group students' skills regarding algorithm development and computational thinking significantly developed compared to those of the control group. Based on the findings, it can be argued that Scratch Program is a learning tool that can be used to develop skills related to algorithm development and computational thinking.

However, the notion of an online STEM camp is still in its beginnings, and there is little relevant research and experience in this context. At the beginning of April 2021, the research team launched an online STEM charity camp with the theme of ""Shen Nong Tastes Herbs."" Participants included 113 third- and fourth-grade primary school students ranging from 8 to 12 years of age from four schools in Karamay, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with weak educational capabilities. The camp lasted for 3 days and included 7 activities, while remote teaching was accomplished through Dingtalk. Pre- and post-test questionnaires and interviews were used to explore the impact of this camp on students. We found that online STEM camps could improve students' self-efficacy, computational thinking, and task value, and there is a significant improvement in the self-efficacy (p = 0.000) and task value (p = 0.001) dimensions. In addition, students with high self-efficacy had higher scores in the other two dimensions. Finally, we summarized the experiences and gains of students and teachers and proposed suggestions for developing online camps based on this experience. What Is Already Known About this Topic • STEM and robotics education have a positive impact on student development. • Students' self-efficacy, computational thinking, and task value are very important and popular research areas in STEM education. • STEM education camps can promote students' teamwork skills and other abilities. However, due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little research concerning online STEM education. What this Paper Contributes • An online STEM education charity camp was launched for schools with weak educational capabilities. • Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the online camp effectively integrated traditional Chinese herbal medicine culture, LEGO robots, and STEM knowledge. • This paper explored the relationship among students'' self-efficacy, computational thinking and task value. Implications for Practice and/or Policy • This paper developed an online STEM course with multidisciplinary integration to provide ideas for instructional designers. • This paper summarized the experience of online STEM education camps and provided suggestions for the implementation of online camps in the future. • This paper encouraged more educators to pay attention to students living in areas with weak educational capabilities and to actually promote the balanced development of education.

10.1007/s10956-022-09965-0,"Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and engineers. However, K–12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in K–12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions.

,"Several western countries have introduced educational policies to keep up with needs and demands of the digital society. Digital competence frameworks, particularly for the teaching profession, may fit into this context, which also includes the development of computational thinking, a competency construct that many consider necessary for the empowerment of citizens. The analysis of the approach to computational thinking in these references provides information on competences that need to be contextualised in the framing of the concept, to ensure conditions for its integration in the educational environment. This analysis is the aim of this study, focusing on four frameworks guiding teacher education policies: Standards of ICT competence for teachers (UNESCO), Common Framework for Teaching Digital Competence (INTEF, Spain), European framework for the digital competence of educators: DigCompEdu (EU) and ISTE Standards for Educators: A Guide for Teachers and Other Professionals (ISTE, USA). Content analysis was used as methodology. Results show that there is no consensus on the definition of computational thinking, although the frameworks, implicitly or explicitly, recognize the importance of integrating computational thinking in teaching practice. However, there is no evidence of methodological guidelines for the operationalization of digital teaching skills that can ensure the promotion of computational thinking. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Los países occidentales han introducido políticas educativas para seguir las exigencias de la sociedad digital. El desarrollo de marcos de referencia de competencia digital para la profesión docente, se integran en este contexto, valorando el desarrollo del pensamiento computacional, un constructo competencial, considerado como necesario para la capacitación de los ciudadanos. El análisis del enfoque del pensamiento computacional puede proporcionarnos información sobre una aproximación al encuadramiento del concepto, con el fin de asegurar las condiciones para su integración en el entorno educativo. Este análisis es el objetivo de este estudio, para el que hemos seleccionado cuatro marcos de competencia que pretenden orientar las políticas de formación del profesorado: Estándares de competencia TIC para profesores (UNESCO), Marco Común de Competencia Digital Docente (INTEF, Spain), Marco europeo para la competencia digital de los educadores: DigCompEdu (EU) and ISTE Estándares para educadores (ISTE, USA). Se utilizó como metodología un análisis de contenido. Los resultados muestran ausencia de consenso sobre la definición de pensamiento computacional, aunque los marcos, implícita o explícitamente, reconozcan la importancia de integrarlo en la práctica. Sin embargo, no hay evidencia de directrices metodológicas para la operacionalización de las competencias digitales docentes que puedan asegurar la promoción del pensamiento computacional.

,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been highlighted as a key competence of the 21st century. The literature has pointed to the use of unplugged activities, including board games (BG), as a strategy to promote the development of Computational Thinking. Recently, new modern board games (MBG), referred to as Eurogames, have aroused the interest of researchers who have underlined their unique design and mechanics. To investigate the impact of the use of MBG on CT development, a systematic literature review (SLR) was structured using the PRISMA protocol as a reference. The focus was centred on the analysis of empirical studies based on the use of board games in school settings to promote CT skills. This paper opens with the presentation of several essential concepts, among which CT and Eurogames are included, followed by the results of the SLR, focusing on the analysed articles, the theoretical frameworks supporting the studies, the research contexts and methods, the data collection instruments and the results reported by the authors. Out of 85 articles, 11 studies published between 2011 and 2021 were analysed. The results suggest that game mechanics, typical of Eurogames, reveal the potential to promote CT. However, the use of these resources requires further exploration. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] El Pensamiento Computacional (PC) ha sido destacado como una competencia clave del siglo XXI.

,"> Context * The meaning and implications of ""computational thinking"" (CT) are only now starting to be clarified, and the applications of the Computer Science (CS) Unplugged approach are becoming clearer as research is appearing. Now is a good time to consider how these relate, and what the opportunities and issues are for teachers using this approach. > Problem * The goal here is to connect computational thinking explicitly to the CS Unplugged pedagogical approach, and to identify the context where Unplugged can be used effectively. > Method * We take a theoretical approach, selecting a representative sample of CS Unplugged activities and mapping them to CT concepts. > Results * The CS Unplugged activities map well onto commonly accepted CT concepts, although caution must be taken not to regard CS Unplugged as being a complete approach to CT education. > Implications * There is evidence that CS Unplugged activities have a useful role to help students and teachers engage with CT, and to support hands-on activities with digital devices. > Constructivist content * A constructivist approach to teaching computer science concepts can be particularly valuable at present because the public (and many teachers who are likely to have to become engaged with the subject) do not see CS as something they are likely to understand. Providing a clear way for anyone to construct this knowledge for themselves gives an opportunity to empower them when it might otherwise have been regarded as a domain that is open to only a select few.

10.3916/C59-2019-06,"The development of programming skills is currently promoting from an early school age, trying to get children to take an active and creative role in the use of technologies. The objective of this article is to verify the repercussion of educational robotics activities on kindergarten students in the acquisition of computational thinking and programming skills. The research design is quasiexperimental, with pre-test and post-test measures, using experimental and control groups. The sample consists of 131 students from the second cycle of early education (between 3 and 6 years old), all from the same Spanish school. Computational thinking is measured through three dimensions: sequences (algorithms), action-instruction correspondence and debugging. The intervention sessions, as well as the structure of the challenges that were used in the pre- and post-test evaluations, were designed based on the reference program of robotics studies called ""TangibleK"". The intervention, carried out doing learning activities using educational robotics resources, presents positive results in relation to the computational thinking skills achieved. The differences between the pre-test and the post-test in the experimental and control groups are statistically significant, in that children engaged in robotics program achieves a greater advance in the three dimensions of computational competence through this method.

,"A rubric is presented to assess debugging skills for students particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The three categories that are assessed for the cognitive processes in debugging skills are identification, isolation, and iteration. These are defined, and the characteristics of each process are listed. We discuss the method used to develop this rubric that was based on intentional errors in a programming assignment given to students in an introductory physics course. The programming in this assignment was in Python and a visual-based programming platform, called iFlow. We believe that visual-based programming will help elicit weaknesses in debugging because it removes students' familiarity with particular programming languages. Our focus on debugging skills came from a survey of students to self-identify barriers in computational work in an introductory physics course that included engineering majors. This skill was the primary self-identified barrier along with abstraction skills, which will be the focus of another work. We also present the results of this survey. The Python assignment (ntext = 9) was used to create the rubric and the iFlow assignment (ngraphic = 11) was used to test the rubric. Scoring was based on a scale of six levels in each category. Although the sample size was too small to establish rigorous scoring reliability, we discussed how the two researchers attained agreement in scoring the assignments after iterative modifications of the rubric and rescoring. For the Python assignment, the average for identification was 2.75/5, for isolation 2.30/5, and for iteration 3.33/5. For the iFlow assignment, the average for identification was 2.63/5, for isolation 2.23/5, and for iterate 3.32/5. A consistent trend from these assignments showed that students' approach to debugging is mainly to identify and iterate without a full understanding of the error (i.e., isolation). The lack of a full understanding of the error implies that students are prone to repeat the error. Thus, the important outcome of debugging is to understand the source of error by systematically investigating different parts of the computational solution. Our preliminary results led to the hypothesis that students with weak debugging skills are mainly due the isolation process. This hypothesis will be tested in a future experiment. Results from such an experiment will be significant to those who are designing intervention strategies to integrate computational thinking in science and engineering curricula.

10.1162/leon_a_01574,"This article positions Andy Warhol as a model for computational thinking and art-making, linking him to concepts in new media art. Warhol's work is analyzed for its variability in form generation and output, both in painting and on the early Amiga computer. His work becomes a simulation of the abstraction of process and methods of production familiar to us in electronic computational art of today. Rather than seen as banal mass production on the modern assembly line, Warhol's work can be seen as inspiration for new media arts practitioners.

10.20511/pyr2020.v8n1.439,"This paper presents the results of two different experiences about computational thinking acquisition, gained within a formal subject taught in a multidisciplinary (Digital Humanities) master program of a face-to-face teaching university of Spain, following a blended learning approach and using flipped classroom techniques. These results have been obtained after imparting lecturing this subject for two consecutive academic years, with similar but distinctive methodologies each. In effect, even though both of them can be considered task-based (or, alternatively, learning-by-doing-based), the first one has focused on group learning and has been inspired by the computer engineering technique of evolutionary prototyping; whereas the second one builds upon individual learning and case-based (or example-based) learning. Thus, the paper details the parameters defined for each experience and methodology (that is, the participants, the materials, the procedures and the evaluation criteria), together with the main conclusions drawn from this study like, for instance, that group learning has not helped as much as individual learning (at least in this case) identify and correct the errors that occurred while assimilating the contents of the subject.

El artículo detalla los distintos parámetros claves de ambas metodologías (participantes, materiales, procedimientos y criterios de evaluación) junto con las principales conclusiones derivadas del estudio como, por ejemplo, que el aprendizaje colaborativo en este caso no facilitó tanto como el aprendizaje individual la identificación y corrección de errores en la asimilación de los contenidos de la asignatura.

The main point of this essay is that the influence goes both ways: creating programs influences how you think. The programs we are talking about are not just the ones we write for a computer. Programs can be implemented on a computer or with physical devices or in your mind. The implementation can bring your ideas to life. Often, though, the implementation and the ideas develop in tandem, each acting as a mirror on the other.

10.1111/jcal.12720,"Background: The idea of computational thinking is underpinned by the belief that anyone can learn and use the underlying concepts of computer science to solve everyday problems. However, most studies on the topic have investigated the development of computational thinking through programming activities, which are cognitively demanding. There is a dearth of evidence on how computational thinking augments everyday problem solving when it is decontextualized from programming. Objectives: In this study, we examined how computational thinking, when untangled from the haze of programming, is demonstrated in everyday problem solving, and investigated the features of such solvable problems. Methods: Using a multiple case study approach, we tracked how seven university students used computational thinking to solve the everyday problem of a route planning task as part of an 8‐week‐long Python programming course. Results and Conclusions: Computational thinking practices are latent in everyday problems, and intentionally structuring everyday problems is valuable for discovering the applicability of computational thinking. Decomposition and abstraction are prominent computational thinking components used to simplify everyday problem solving. Implications: It is important to strike a balance between the correctness of algorithms and simplification of the process of everyday problem solving. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking is a problem solving skill.Computational thinking is different from programming.There is dearth of evidence on how computational thinking augments everyday problem solving. What this paper adds: Computational thinking practices are latent in everyday problem solving.Intentional restructuring of problems is required to uncover how computational thinking applies in solving them.

10.1177/01614681221104043,"Background: Multilingual learners have been overlooked and understudied in computer science education research. As the CS for All movement grows, it is essential to design integrated, justice-oriented curricula that help young multilingual learners begin to develop computational thinking skills and discourses. Purpose: We present a conceptual framework and accompanying design principles for justice-centered computational thinking activities that are language-rich, with the aim of supporting learners' agency and building their capacity over time to use computing for good in their communities. Setting: Our work takes place in a research–practice partnership centered in an elementary school in California with a significant multilingual Latinx population. Research Design: We have engaged in two cycles of design-based research with preservice and in-service teachers at an elementary school. Through analysis of one case study during the second and most recent cycle, we examined the potential of teachers using our design principles for supporting multilingual learners' language development through engagement in computational thinking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multilingual learners will engage in productive discourse when computational thinking lessons are designed to (1) be meaningfully contextualized, (2) position students as agentic learners, and (3) promote coherence over time. However, more research is needed to understand how teachers use these principles over time, and what additional supports are needed to ensure coordination between stakeholders to develop and effectively implement coherent learning progressions.

,"> Context * The increasing and evolving presence of technology in the lives of children is reflected in the recognition in many educational frameworks that students should possess and be able to demonstrate computational thinking skills as part of their problem-solving practice. > Problem * We discuss the process of creating tasks for the so-called Bebras challenge, a contest on informatics (computing) and computational thinking addressing school students of all ages. These tasks have a short problem statement and should be solvable in a few minutes. The challenge explored is how to formulate and structure such tasks so that there is still enough space for creativity in the solution process and how to organize the learning settings so that constructionist learning is supported. > Method * We give an experience report about the creation and use of short tasks for learning computational thinking. We argue that the constructionist perspective involving the use of the Bebras-like tasks on computational thinking offers an appropriate frame for enriching learning activities, fostering collaborative and individual creativity. A process-oriented approach was selected for the research done in a study where we observed children's activities in solving the short tasks on computational thinking. > Results - Our analysis of the creativity, as exemplified in several observations of pupils while solving short tasks that involve computing concepts (the Bebras cards), shows that this kind of microlearning serves well to motivate pupils to be more interested in particular computing topics. The concept of the short tasks meets the usual way of teaching in primary education. Pupils and teachers develop a positive attitude to computing related topics.

10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105126,"Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students' cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education. • Studied self-regulated learning 's developmental dynamics with cognition. • Investigated using a mixed method to a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a program. • Revealed a reinforcing relationship between SRL and cognitive CT abilities over time. • Discovered positive impacts of educational tools on cognitive CT abilities.

10.1007/s10643-024-01694-w,"Educators and researchers are becoming interested in cultivating computational thinking (CT). However, in the Hong Kong context, CT-related studies regarding young children are rarely found. The present study aimed to use an unplugged digital arts activity to examine the CT concepts that children performed and document their CT developmental trajectories. Constructionism theory highlights the importance of children engaging in hands-on activities and developing independent thinking skills. Meanwhile, social constructivism theory emphasizes the role of teachers as scaffolders, supporting children in their learning processes. A sample of children (<italic>N</italic> = 27, aged 3–6) was recruited from a nursery school in Hong Kong to participate in an animation art workshop. A total of 540 min of video data was recorded and collected for content analysis. The teaching team (<italic>N</italic> = 4) for this workshop were invited to write up their reflective journals, capturing their observations of the scaffolding strategies employed and their perspectives on how children at various levels demonstrated their understanding of CT concepts throughout the entire process. Within an analytical framework based on powerful ideas, the findings from the observations and field notes revealed that the children’s CT concepts and practices could be linked with the CT conceptual framework. In this study, older children showed a sophisticated competency and a more complicated mind structure in terms of the CT concept. Our findings highlight the importance of designing an age-appropriate curriculum for nurturing the computational thinking of young children through animation art.

10.1007/s10956-024-10130-y,"In the digital age in which we live, one of the primary goals of education is to nurture individuals who are capable of thinking creatively, solving problems, and being innovative and productive. Computational thinking is an analytical process that requires defining problems and at the same time solving these problems by proceeding in creative ways. Based on this possible pattern of relationship between computational thinking and creativity, the aim of this study was to determine how two different versions of the computational thinking approach (plugged and unplugged) affect 6th-grade students' creative problem-solving skills (CPSS). Thus, two different teaching modules were designed on the circulatory system with a focus on plugged and unplugged computational thinking. A quasi-experimental design was used. Experiment group 1 utilized the plugged teaching module, experiment group 2 worked with the unplugged teaching module, and the control group in the Turkish middle school science curriculum's inquiry-based science activities. All three groups participated in 16 h of lessons over a 4-week period. We utilized the Creative Problem Solving Skills Inventory (CPSSI) for data collection. The results demonstrated that both the plugged and unplugged teaching modules were more successful at enhancing the CPSS than the inquiry-based science activities. Furthermore the unplugged teaching module was significantly more successful in developing CPSS compared to inquiry-based science activities. Hence, this empirical study demonstrated that both plugged and unplugged computational thinking approaches can enhance CPSS, but also reveals the greater effectiveness of unplugged approaches in fostering middle school students' CPSS.

This meta-synthesis of 49 studies critically reviews recent international research (2009–2022) of coding and computational thinking as core and integrated across the curriculum. It addresses four essential problems: (a) What are the key features of learning environments that successfully develop students’ coding and computational thinking? (b) What is the impact of student engagement in coding and computational thinking on learning outcomes across curriculum areas? (c) What pedagogical constraints are evident for coding and computational thinking, including across curriculum areas? and (d) Which conceptual frameworks support coding and computational thinking, and what has been marginalized or excluded? The review advances knowledge of coding and computational thinking—vital to guide and develop future AI-based solutions to real-world problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries.

CO was a two-team strategy board game and was designed for children developing basic understanding of computational thinking. Participation observations and interviews were conducted to explained students' novice player experiences, learned CT after their first-time exposures to CO, and usability feedback to the board game. The major findings of this study were two- fold. First, students were motivated and engaged, using board games to learn computational thinking. The winning strategies that students generated throughout the game promoted higher-order computational thinking. Second, students comprehended and interpreted the conceptual elements of computational thinking well after playing the game, having only a fraction of misconceptions. Overall, novice young players' experience were positive, and they provided usability feedback and direction to improving CO. We suggest the game designers in providing supporting elements such as table masters training and course-bundle packages, and developing a series of contextual orientations that will engage novice players.

The experiment consisted of participants using the Scratch Program and Creative Computing Guidebook, both developed by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) media laboratory, for a total of 15 hours. An experimental group and a control group were formed and consisted of fourth to sixth graders. DBL was applied to the experimental group, while a traditional, direct method of teaching was applied to the control group. The experiment was designed to examine several aspects of learning: self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. Moreover, we compared changes in students’ perceptions of computers and analysed differences in students’ responses between the two groups according to each of the steps of DBL. Then, we verified the effects of DBL by examining the progress of each group and the differences between the two groups. At the end of the experiment, we found that both groups showed enhanced self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. However, the experimental group had a greater number of significant positive changes than the control group did in all areas (p < .01). In conclusion, the findings presented herein demonstrated that applying DBL is more effective for improving CT than traditional methodologies are.

Using scientific inquiry skills and practices, students were tasked with assessing the validity of local rollercoaster g-force ratings as posted to the public. Students used computational electronic textile circuits (e-textiles) to engage in ""myth busting"" amusement park g-force ratings. In doing so, students engaged computing and computational thinking skills in service to answering their scientific inquiry. Findings from this study indicate that physics classes are ideal spaces for engaging in computing's Big Ideas as laid out by Grover and Pea (Educational Researcher 42, 38–43, 2013) as well as the pillars of computational thinking (Wing, Communications of the ACM 49, 33–35, 2006). However, essential to this dual engagement is a need for computing content to act in service to the better acquisition of physics content within the physics classroom space. Findings indicate that the teachers' use of e-textiles to integrate physics and computing broadened and deepened student learning by providing affordances for computational thinking within the structure of physical science inquiry.

10.1007/s10956-021-09934-z,"Studies maintain that computational thinking (CT) is associated with science content and scientific processes as well as with many disciplines. It is thought that designing teaching processes in which science and CT processes take place together makes science learning more meaningful. With this in mind, in this study, the researchers integrated unplugged CT practices into the subject of digestive system to provide an example, and analyzed the effect of this integration on learning through students' model-based explanations by comparing it with the traditional teaching. The findings reveal that in the teaching processes that were designed based on CT practices, the total scores of the students' model-based explanations were significantly higher compared to the traditional approach. When the researchers analyzed the model-based explanations under different sub-features, it was found that this difference was mostly related to sequence and explanatory process sub-features. This reinforces the idea that CT is effective on learning complex and difficult content. Students can reflect their relational and conditional thinking, and thinking in levels practices they perform via CT activities to their scientific models and science content explanations. We believe that these findings will contribute to the scholarship on CT and science integration, which is a trending topic in the literature, and will offer insights to researchers.

,"There is a growing interest in developing students' interest in computer science and computational thinking as computing has become ubiquitous in various fields. This has led to a plethora of online educational platforms offering computer science content for learning. There are several advantages and disadvantages of existing platforms. To address the current limitation of both the paid and free online learning activities, we present the Curated Pathways to Innovation (CPI), an innovative platform that utilizes machine learning techniques to curate and personalize readily available computational learning material online. Initial results suggest that students benefit from using CPI. Not only are students exposed to developmentally appropriate and personally salient computer science-related content aligned with educational standards, but they also experience a significant increase in their attitudes towards computer science activities, particularly those involving computer programming and computational thinking. In this way, CPI is highly scalable, having the potential to reach a broad audience of learners by curating content from an integrated set of educational resources and thus also orienting a future generation of students towards careers in computer science and related fields. The strengths of this approach, as well as opportunities for future platform, content, and curriculum development, are considered.

10.5195/palrap.2018.188,"Computational thinking has become a popular and important concept in education throughout the nation. Public libraries, with their technology services and their role as an informal learning space, have been tagged as an ideal place for computational thinking learning for children. However, the literature and research surrounding computational thinking is often vague and even misleading, presenting differing visions of what computational thinking is, what it should look like in practice, and how it might be evaluated for effectiveness. As a result, youth services librarians face many challenges in their attempts to understand, design, and evaluate computational thinking programs for their libraries. This paper explores the issues inherent in current computational thinking research and discusses the challenges they represent in designing and facilitating youth computational thinking programs in public libraries, as well as presents recommendations for best practices.

,"As young people increasingly need computer science (CS) and other related STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) skills, libraries have been identified as spaces in which this learning can occur. However, librarians often perceive they lack the skills or confidence required to lead this type of education. As a result, funding sources, professional organizations, and researchers are examining the ways computational thinking (CT) can be better incorporated into graduate-level library science curriculum. Six graduate-level faculty members teaching courses related to school and public library youth services were selected as part of a larger research project. They redesigned their courses to incorporate CT concepts. In this study, we examined how CT concepts were incorporated into the syllabi objectives, how these concepts influenced the course objectives from previous iterations of these courses, and how various accreditation and state requirements influenced the development of course objectives. The findings can inform course development of graduate-level library science curriculum. The findings also document the ways existing standards align with the developing need for computational thinking, computer science, and STEM learning within the curriculum.

10.1111/jcal.12545,"Promoting the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in the K‐12 curriculum, however, there is no unified conclusion on how to design programming activities to promote the acquisition of CT skills more effectively. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using programming to enhance K‐12 students' CT skills and explore the influence of various programming instructional design factors on the acquisition of CT skills. This study presents a quantitative meta‐analysis. A systematic search of randomized controlled studies on the influence of programming on CT skills. A total of 86 empirical studies with 114 effect sizes met the study selection criterion. The results showed that programming improved K‐12 students' CT skills in general (Hedges' g = 0.601, 95% CI [0.505, 0.697], p < 0.001). No publication bias was detected. Besides, we found that the interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within 1 week to 1 month, the class size of less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and CT assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills. Based on these findings, we suggest that programming instructional design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills. This will be of great significance to programming teaching and CT education in K‐12. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in K‐12 has become a key issue.One of the latest trends in the education field is computer programming in K‐12 classrooms to cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design may affect the influence of programming education on students' CT skills. However, there is a lack of overall quantitative synthesis of existing empirical research. What this paper adds: A meta‐analysis of 86 studies was conducted to provide systematic evidence that programming education is effective to promote K‐12 students' CT skills.Programming teaching design factors such as subjects, intervention duration, sample size, programming instruments and assessment types can affect CT skills in programming activities.Programming activity forms cannot affect CT skills in programming activities. Implications for practice and/or policy: The implementation of programming education in K‐12 schooling can effectively cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills.The interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within one week to one month, control of class size to less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills.

A total of 289 students (146 female, 143 male) enrolled in four different middle schools in one province of Turkey participated in this study. Three different data collection tools were used in the study: Science Technology Engineering Mathematics-Career Interest Survey, computational thinking scale, and the scale of attitude towards inquiry. The data were analyzed using the structural regression model, which is one of the structural equation models. A significant correlation was found between the middle school students' computational thinking skills and their STEM career interest and attitudes toward inquiry. In this context, efforts can be made to develop computational thinking skills, such as creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperative thinking, and critical thinking to increase middle school students' STEM career interest and attitudes toward inquiry.

However, few studies have examined whether CT attitudes influence CT skills. The present study examines the relationship between CT attitudes and CT skills for preservice teachers (PSTs). The Callysto CT test (CCTt) for Teachers was administered to $n\,\,=$ 105 PSTs to measure their CT attitudes and skills. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship of participants’ CT and problem-solving skills with their attitudes toward CT, technology, coding, and data. Findings revealed that CT attitudes predicted CT skills and provided the first step in exploring the validity and reliability of the CCTt instrument.

One of the key components for students to accomplish this is to take part in today's participatory culture, which involves becoming creators of knowledge rather than being passive consumers of information. The advancement and accessibility of computing technologies has the potential to engage students in this process. Drawing from the recent publication of two educational frameworks in the fields of computational thinking and media & information literacy and from their practical applications, this article proposes an integrated approach to develop students' 21st century skills that supports educators' integration of 21st century skills in the classroom.

,"Computational Thinking (CT) is typically construed as an essential competence in solving problems and designing complex systems in the digital world. Robotics programs provide learning environments for acquiring core computational thinking skills. This study first proposes a framework of computational thinking in the context of engineering (CT-ENG), using qualitative content analysis on industry interviews. The authors then introduce the program of the Robotics Class of Zhejiang University in China, providing an integrative approach to teaching computational thinking effectively. The Robotics Class engages students in project-based computing-aided engineering activities throughout the four-year bachelor's program, and improves their computational thinking skills through engineering engagement. The findings in this study could have some implications for non-CS engineering majors to promote computing education and equip students with computational thinking at digital era.

The Computational Thinking Skills Scale was administered to preservice teachers. Firstly, a basic programming training was given and then it was asked to create group projects on a voluntary basis. Six of twelve groups created a project using the Arduino IDE platform and the other six created one using the C++ programming language. Accordingly, a significant difference, which is in favour of the post-test, was found in the scores of pre-tests and post-tests of Arduino IDE groups in the scale factors; creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking and the total score of the scale. No significant difference was found in cooperativity and problem solving factors. Also, the results of the study did not reveal any significant difference between the scores of pre and post-tests of C++ project groups and overall scores of different groups.

Wing's initial article and subsequent writings on CT have been broadly influential; experts in computational thinking have started developing teaching and leadership materials to support integration of CT across the K-12 curriculum. Despite interest at the K-12 level, however, outside of computer science and other science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields there has been less interest in -and research conducted on- the potential of CT in higher education. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state of the field in higher education and discuss whether CT skills are relevant outside of STEM fields.

However, incorporating in mathematics or other disciplines is not a straightforward process and introduces many challenges concerning the way disciplines are organised and taught in school. The aim of this paper is to identify what characterises CT in mathematics education and which CT aspects can be addressed within mathematics education. First, we present a systematic literature review that identifies characteristics of CT that have been explored in mathematics education research. Second, we present the results of a Delphi study conducted to capture the collective opinion of 25 mathematics and computer science experts regarding the opportunities for addressing CT in mathematics education. The results of the Delphi study, which corroborate the findings of the literature review, highlight three important aspects of CT to be addressed in mathematics education: problem solving, cognitive processes, and transposition.

To cope with these trends, a learning activity was developed and implemented in Taiwan's primary teacher education curriculum. The activity aimed to help preservice primary teachers learn about Scratch visual programing and micro:bit microcontroller boards by engaging in a physical computing project involving the design of an educational motion sensor game about energy. The results of the preliminary study found that the preservice primary teachers who participated in the activity were able to collaborate and develop motion sensor games suitable for primary school students. They also demonstrated significant improvements in their computational thinking concepts (t (10) = 3.13, p <.05) and energy knowledge test scores (t (10) = 2.74, p <.05).

While CT has a growing presence within K-12 classrooms, libraries play an essential role in introducing these critical skills to all. Objective: Assessing learning in libraries is difficult given their informal nature. This is especially true when trying to assess a new and ill-defined construct like CT. A first step towards better supporting informal educators is to identify the motivations for bringing CT into informal spaces and to understand the current state of assessing CT in public libraries. Method: Thirty-seven interviews with library staff from across the United States were conducted and analyzed. Findings: This work reveals the variety of motivations justifying the inclusion of CT programming for youth in libraries, the challenges associated with assessing CT in libraries, and identifies the assessments library staff would like to be able to conduct for their own CT-related programming. Implications: This work advances our understanding of the current state of CT assessment in public libraries and lays the groundwork for future work seeking to meet the needs of those tasked with bringing CT to youth beyond the classroom.

The concept of computational thinking education is to allow students to find solutions to problems in different fields by understanding the problems and analyzing solution steps. In this study, we integrate the concept of computational thinking education into a course on plot image-based virtual reality (VR). It combined shooting of the actual field, instructions on the movie required to be shot, and VR in order to enable students to get immersed in thinking about problems and understanding the actual field through plot image-based VR, further plan to learn the essence of problems, and develop possible solutions. Through experimental results of experimental and control groups, we found that plot image-based VR can effectively improve students' interests in learning and computational thinking.

10.1111/jcal.12493,"Computational thinking (CT) plays a vital role in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). However, whether students' learning attitude towards STEM is related to their CT skills remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to address this knowledge gap. In Study 1, we validated a newly developed STEM learning attitude scale among a sample of Chinese primary school students (N = 489). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the scale which consisted of three factors (mathematics, science and information technology) could sufficiently measure primary school students' STEM learning attitude in the current sample. In Study 2, we explored the association between students' STEM learning attitude and their CT skills. Evidence revealed that learning attitude towards STEM significantly predicted CT skills. We also found that girls had a more positive learning attitude towards STEM than boys, and the fourth grade might be the key period for the development of CT skills. Implications for promoting primary school students' STEM learning and CT skills were also discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) plays a more and more important role in K‐12 education.STEM has become a natural field for integrating CT into classroom.Students' learning attitude determines their performance and achievements.CT is influenced by personal and situational factors.

The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners' activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104962,"Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students' existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences. • Most elementary school students are aware that they can use CT to solve problems. • Graphic organizers can help elementary school students improve their CT and programming skill. • Students can reach a higher flow experience when learning with Graphic organizers. • Graphic organizers are worthwhile as a tool for teaching and learning programming.

,"We propose a novel approach to improve computational thinking (CT) and computer programming (CP) via a disciplinary-based problem solving approach. We hypothesize that the syntax needed for writing a computer code can be introduced through support programs in problem solving. This article demonstrates this approach through the problem of non-linear pendulum, a familiar problem solved in most engineering and physics classes. It is basically focused on implementing numerical techniques for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Instead of using a syntax-based teaching approach, support programs can be used to identify the required coding elements. We envision that this approach can be transferable to many problems in STEM classes to motivate students towards computer programming.

10.1111/jcal.12527,"Persistence has been identified as a crucial quality of learning. However, it is hard to attain in online game‐based environments as the drive to progress in the game may influence the ability to achieve the learning goals. This study aimed to examine the associations between micro‐persistence, that is, the tendency to complete an individual task successfully, and task difficulty while acquiring computational thinking (CT). We further explored whether contextual or personal attributes better explain micro‐persistence. We analysed data of 111 school students who used the CodeMonkey platform. We took a learning analytics approach for analysing the platform's log files. We found that micro‐persistence is associated with task difficulty and that students who demonstrated an aptitude to learn new material are motivated to achieve the best solution. We also found that contextual variables better‐explained micro‐persistence than personal attributes. Encouraging micro‐persistence can improve CT acquisition and the learning processes involved. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Persistence is a substantial quality for learning.In online multi‐challenge environments, it is difficult to maintain persistence because of the urge to advance in the game itself.Persistence has been mostly studied with regarding the learning process as a whole. What this paper adds: Examination of micro‐persistence, that is, persistence at the task level.Students who demonstrate micro‐persistence and aptitude to learn new material are motivated to achieve the highest score.Contextual variables better explain micro‐persistence than personal attributes. Implications of study findings for practitioners: Micro‐persistence may lead to better and deeper learning.Instructional designers who want to maintain micro‐persistence should monitor the difficulty of individual learning tasks.Educators should motivate learners to complete learning tasks and not rely solely on intrinsic motivation.

Objective: Determine if the analysis of students' interactions with an online platform allows understanding the development of CT, how we can convert data collected into valuable insights, and the aspects that should be considered in platforms design. Method: We developed an online platform with a fine-grained log–recording system. We analysed the data collected from 1004 students (ages 8-14) to understand the difficulties they face. We explain our platform and the tools to process and filter the interaction logs. We calculate additional indicators that provide useful information about student's behaviour. Findings: Age and gender have shown to influence on CT learning. Generating additional indicators from basic interaction data provide valuable insights. We provide a list of recommendations for developing more effective programming learning platforms.

Assessments of Computational Thinking (CT) are essential for capturing information about student learning and challenges. When programming is used as a vehicle to foster CT skills, assessment of CT skills needs to measure understanding of programming concepts alongside general problem-solving practices applicable in contexts beyond programming. Objective: In this paper, we discuss the development of and results from separate validated assessments of programming concepts and generic CT practices for 4th-6th grade students. Method: An Evidence-Centered Design approach was used for the development and validation of the assessments, that were used with 15,000 upper elementary students in Hong Kong. Findings: Results from assessment implementation indicate that the assessments worked as designed and reveal student challenges with CT concepts and practices. Implications: These results point to the utility of our assessment as a curricular tool and the need for emphasizing certain CT concepts and practices in future curricular initiatives and teacher professional development.

10.1080/10494820.2019.1573199,"Previous research has invested much effort in understanding how programming can contribute to the development of young learners' computational thinking (CT) in traditional K-12 classroom settings. Relatively few studies have examined programming for CT in informal online communities, especially for large scale quantitative research. With the repurposing and appropriation of code becoming standard practice for youth programmers in new and networked communities, this study proposes a model to investigate and explain how such remixing practices influence CT in learners. In particular, we use social cognitive theory to transform log data from more than 100,000 students and 200,000 programs in the Scratch online community into cognitive, environmental and behavioral factors. Then path modeling was used to show how the community environment can affect learners' remixing and further impact CT skills. The results demonstrate the intertwined relationships among the factors, generally showing that remixing can lead to CT improvement, but that over exposure to the community and excessive remixing can actually hinder CT development. Results and implications are further discussed.

A primary obstacle to integrating computational thinking into teaching and learning is the level of teachers' knowledge, skills, and perceptions related to this topic. This study aimed to determine the views of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) teachers regarding using information and communications technology within their teaching, emphasizing computational thinking within lessons, and conceptually developing levels of computational thinking skills. Another aim was to examine whether these variables differed according to educational discipline, teaching experience, and graduation factors. Data collection was conducted via an online questionnaire completed by participating teachers. One hundred twenty-one (121) teachers from 38 middle schools (34 public and 4 private) in seven different cities in the Republic of Turkey participated. An F test was used to determine whether selected scales, translated from an ICILS 2018 Teacher Questionnaire, differentiated according to educational discipline, teaching experience, and/or graduation factors. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine relationships between variables used in data collection. Results indicated that teachers need a sufficient level of education and guidance regarding incorporating information and communications technology into their lessons as well as how to consistently use these tools within their classrooms.

,"Publicised by Wing and later expanded on, computational thinking purports to be the foundation of thought for coming generations, an indispensable skill-set that compulsory education must provide. The target article uses small tasks to develop skills relevant to computational science and computing, and explores the student interaction with these tasks. Useful skills may be developed by these students, but the article does not explicitly connect these tasks to computational thinking skills or competencies. This causes the reader to ask the question: are they developing computational thinking, or some other set of computer-related skills? A more fundamental question, and one beyond the scope of the target article, is what are the skills that are ultimately unique for computational thinking?

The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase ""disciplinary perspective"" simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.

The workshops convened a working group of principal investigators, researchers, and educators from the National Science Foundation (NSF) ITEST (Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers) and STEM + C (STEM + Computing) funded projects to draft an interdisciplinary framework for integrating CT into K–12 education. The goal of this paper is to share that framework and our findings on promising learning progressions, gaps that exist in the collected set of activities, specific advances in STEM fields that were made possible through CT, and suggested ways that CT integration in K-12 can evolve to reach what the CT integration framework proposes as five ""computational thinking integration elements"" or ""CTIEs"".

10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105012,"Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity. • Computational thinking in writing courses improves higher-order thinking skills. • Teaching intervention based on Computational Thinking enhances writing skills. • Computational thinking allows students to become better writers via peer feedback. • Computational Thinking and writing develop creativity and problem-solving skills.

We seek to understand this dynamic using a multi-stage analysis of over 14,000 comments on Scratch, an online platform designed to support learning about programming. First, we inductively develop the concept of ""participatory debugging""—a practice in which users learn through the process of collaborative technical troubleshooting. Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call ""topic porousness"" to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics. We integrate these findings in a framework that highlights a productive tension between the desire to promote learning and the interest-driven sub-communities that drive user engagement in many new media environments.

We discuss students' understanding of the relationship between a simple model of an ecosystem and the actual phenomenon it represents, their engagement with the unit's data-gathering and data analysis activities, their ability to engage in sense-making regarding data they generated and analyzed, and how collectively the study supports their understanding of the complex system.

Unfortunately, students have few opportunities to develop the skills and conceptual knowledge required for a systems perspective. Simulated computational models are promising tools to help students achieve a systems perspective. We examined one lesson that uses simulations of a computational model to teach students about cellular respiration, and we report on its effectiveness to improve systems thinking skills and conceptual knowledge. Concept models revealed that the lesson helped the students identify, relate, and interconnect the components of cellular respiration, thereby improving aspects of their systems thinking skills and conceptual knowledge.

10.1080/10986065.2020.1779012,"This article investigates how the recent implementation of programming in school mathematics interacts with algebraic thinking and learning. Based on Duval's theory of semiotic representations, we analyze in what ways syntax and semantics of programming languages are aligned with or divert from corresponding algebraic symbolism. Three examples of programming activities suggested for school mathematics are discussed in detail. We argue that although the semiotic representations of programming languages are similar to algebraic notation the meanings of several concepts in these two domains differ. In a learning perspective these differences must be taken into account, especially considering that students have to convert between registers with both overlapping and specific meanings.

The study, conducted with relational screening model, included 703 secondary school students. ""STEM attitude scale,"" ""thinking styles scale,"" and ""computational thinking scale"" were used as data collection tools. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Based on the study results, it was concluded that the proposed model was valid and STEM attitude and thinking styles had a significant effect on CT skills. It was found that STEM attitude and thinking styles together explained 43% of CT skills.

10.1080/10494820.2018.1534245,"The role of programming in computing education for children has grown rapidly in recent years with the proliferation of specially designed programming tools, which is grounded on Seymour Papert's theoretical work in Constructionism. Studies show that some children can develop computational thinking skills and practices with programming activities when learning with the tools through a well-design curriculum in elementary education (or primary education). However, existing studies may not completely address whether programming skills and computational thinking can be connected to the development of other generic skills, which are considered important to the learning and cognitive development of children. This study investigates the impact of programming on three learning competencies (creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving) known as twenty-first century skills. The conceptual mapping between programming, computational thinking and the three learning competencies is presented. In a one-year intervention in a primary school, students were taught how to build interactive games through programming, and thus explored some basic computational thinking concepts in class. Our results show that children perceived a significant impact of programming on their learning competencies. Yet, the transferability of twenty-first century skills developed through computational thinking and programming may require a further study. Our study provides insights from children as primary respondents to help direct future research in the field of programming and computational thinking education and its potential impact on twenty-first century skills.

Nonetheless, there are few studies which attempt to analyse their influence at the stage of Primary Education. We present the results of a quasi-experimental piece of research with sixth-grade students which studies the influence of Scratch both on the acquisition of mathematical concepts, and on the development of computational thinking. The experiment consisted of two different phases, a programming phase linked to the instruction in Scratch and focused on the acquisition of basic concepts of computational thinking (sequences, iterations, conditionals, and events-handling), and a mathematical phase completely oriented towards the resolution of mathematical tasks. In particular, the mathematical phase focused on word problems whose resolution involves the use of the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor. In order to evaluate the aims of the study, results from tests before and after instruction, both in computational thinking and in the mathematical standards, were compared. The results seem to indicate that Scratch can be used to develop both students' mathematical ideas and computational thinking.

Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers' views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.

10.1080/10494820.2019.1612445,"A key debate in computer science education is whether and how computational thinking (CT) is used within disciplines other than computer science. Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics. We compare these elements of mathematical thinking to related elements of CT to identify synergies and differences between CT and mathematical thinking. We argue that these synergies and differences have implications for the development of integrated instruction designed to bring CS to all.

10.1007/s10956-020-09812-0,"Computational thinking requires high cognitive load as students work to manage multiple tasks in their problem-solving environment. Through research in K-2 classrooms on computational thinking, we noticed that students lack the representational fluency needed to move from one form to another—such as moving from physical to more abstract representations. Therefore, the following research question was studied: How do second-grade students use and translate among representations to solve computational thinking tasks using the robot mouse game? To address this, we employed a task-based interview approach with three second-grade students who were engaged in four computational thinking tasks using the Code and Go Robot Mouse Coding Activity Set developed by Learning Resources. Through four clinical tasks involving the robot mouse, students solved puzzles set up to force them to make particular representational translations. Each translation involved a level of cognitive complexity the students needed to manage to successfully complete the task. We found that students translated between many different representations using concrete representations to ease translations, language as a scaffold between translations, and embodied movements as representations or to assist with translation. Furthermore, the levels of representational maturity showed by the students varied with the difficulty of the task, and the spatial orientation was particularly difficult for them. These results provide important insights into how learners may develop their ability to engage with abstract representations that will be part of future practices associated with activities in science, mathematics, engineering, and computational thinking.

To properly cultivate CT skills and the related dispositions, educators must understand students' needs and build awareness of how CT informs a deeper understanding of the academic content area. ""Assessing Computational Thinking in Maker Activities"" (ACTMA) is a design-based research study that developed a curricular unit around physics, making, and CT. The project in this paper studied how instructors could use formative assessment to uncover students' prior knowledge and improve their use of CT. This study aims to provide a qualitative analysis of one lesson in the unit implementation of an informal makerspace environment that strived to be culturally responsive. The study examined ""moments of notice,"" or instances where formative assessment could guide students' understanding of CT. We found elements in the establishment of a classroom culture that can generate a continual use of informal formative assessment between instructors and students. This culture includes using materials in conjunction with the promotion of CT concepts and dispositions, focusing on drawing for understanding, the practice of debugging, and fluidity of roles in the learning space.

10.1007/s11423-022-10093-0,"Existing computational thinking (CT) research focuses on programming in K-12 education; however, there are challenges in introducing it into the formal disciplines. Therefore, we propose the introduction of non-programming plugged learning in mathematics to develop students’ CT. The research and teaching teams collaborated to develop an instructional design for primary school students. The participants were 112 third- and fourth-grade students (aged 9–10) who took part in three rounds of experiments. In this paper, we present an iterative problem-solving process in design-based implementation research, focusing on the implementation issues that lead to the design principles in the mathematics classroom. The computational tasks, environment, tools, and practices were iteratively improved over three rounds to incorporate CT effectively into mathematics. Results from the CT questionnaire demonstrated that the new program could significantly improve students’ CT abilities and compound thinking. The results of the post-test revealed that CT, including the sub-dimensions of decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving improved threefold compared to the pre-test between the three rounds, indicating that strengthened CT design enhanced CT perceptions. Similarly, the students’ and teacher’ interviews confirmed their positive experiences with CT. Based on empirical research, we summarize design characteristics from computational tasks, computational environment and tools, and computational practices and propose design principles. We demonstrate the potential of non-programming plugged learning for developing primary school students’ CT in mathematics.

10.1007/s10643-023-01581-w,"Computational thinking (CT) is an important twenty-first century skill that begins developing early. Recent interest in incorporating early CT experiences in early childhood education (i.e., preschool) has increased. In fact, the early years mark an important time during which initial competencies are acquired, interest and motivation begins to form, and in which children may develop a sense of belonging in STEM fields. As a result, providing children with access to robotics and computer science experiences to support CT that are also developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant is key. This paper uses the “powerful ideas” of computer science, seven developmentally appropriate CT concepts that children can learn, as a framework and explores the experiences of two (composite) teachers who participated in and co-developed a culturally relevant robotics program and the processes they undertake to support children’s CT development and learning. This paper considers practices that support the seven key powerful ideals while leveraging existing instructional routines and contexts that are already occurring in most classrooms, such as centers, small group activities, classroom environments, and read-alouds. Of note, this paper prioritizes approaches that acknowledge, center, and feature the ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds of young children and their families. Identifying affordable and accessible practices, this paper provides educators with tangible, integrated, and authentic practices to support children’s computational thinking, STEM learning, and sense of belonging.

10.1111/jcal.12976,"Background: Science teachers' understanding of the roles of computing practices in science frame how they enact scientific computational practices in their teaching and how their students perceive the relationship between computational practices and scientific endeavours. Objectives: This critical, integrative review synthesizes teacher learning literature about the role of computational literacy and computing practices in K‐12 science teaching. Methods: We examined 54 peer‐reviewed articles and analysed the ways the researchers and teacher participants describe the affordances of integrating computational thinking (CT) and other computational practices in science. We characterize how CT and computational practices are framed in relation to scientific learning goals. We identify six primary affordances for integrating computational practices with science that are conveyed to teachers and by teachers, as represented in these studies of teacher learning. Results and Conclusions: These six perspectives include (1) learning computer science principles, (2) developing CT dispositions, (3) engagement and inclusion in science, (4) taking ownership of science, (5) supporting learning science content, and (6) participating in computational practice as a form of scientific epistemic practice. Our analysis indicates that computational thinking and computational practices are often integrated in science in order to teach something about computing (e.g., Perspective 1), rather than to support learners' scientific work. Only the 29 articles coded for the sixth perspective—that is, in service of epistemic aims in science—demonstrate commitment to students' uses of computational ideas and practices as epistemic tools to participate in the sensemaking work of science. Takeaways: Comparison of Perspectives 5 and 6 illustrates the nuance between computational practices in science that reify something students have already ""figured out,"" rather than those that serve epistemic goals. Perspective 6 encapsulates the deep synergy among (1) the reflexive nature of computing with scientific ideas and (2) computing as a central practice in science and engineering. We contend that a more focused message of computational practices in service of scientific sensemaking goals is necessary if we expect teachers to enact CT and related computational practices in their classrooms. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Science teachers' understanding of the roles of computing practices in science frame how they enact scientific computational practices in their teaching. What this paper adds?: We analysed 54 peer‐reviewed articles regarding teacher learning about the role of computational literacy and computing practices in K‐12 science teaching.We characterized the ways the researchers and teacher participants describe the affordances of integrating computational thinking (CT) and other computational practices in science.We present six primary affordances for integrating computational practices with science that are conveyed to teachers and by teachers, as represented in these studies of teacher learning.

We developed a new instrument called TechCheck for assessing CT skills in young children that does not require prior knowledge of computer programming. TechCheck is based on developmentally appropriate CT concepts and uses a multiple-choice ""unplugged"" format that allows it to be administered to whole classes or online settings in under 15 min. This design allows assessment of a broad range of abilities and avoids conflating coding with CT skills. We validated the instrument in a cohort of 5–9-year-old students (N = 768) participating in a research study involving a robotics coding curriculum. TechCheck showed good reliability and validity according to measures of classical test theory and item response theory. Discrimination between skill levels was adequate. Difficulty was suitable for first graders and low for second graders. The instrument showed differences in performance related to race/ethnicity. TechCheck scores correlated moderately with a previously validated CT assessment tool (TACTIC-KIBO). Overall, TechCheck has good psychometric properties, is easy to administer and score, and discriminates between children of different CT abilities. Implications, limitations, and directions for future work are discussed.

In this paper, we take a place-based approach to examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10–16) in a rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based, mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.

However, there is not consensus on a guiding framework, definition, or set of proxies in which to measure CT. We are addressing this problem by using Evidence Centered Design (ECD) to develop an assessment of kindergarten-aged children's CT. Objective: To present a design case on the development of the assessment, specifically the algorithmic thinking (AT) tasks and to share validity evidence that emerged. Method: We focus on the AT sub-component of CT and present the principled assessment design process using ECD. Findings: Our operationalization of CT includes spatial reasoning as a sub-component. Pilot results showed an acceptable internal consistency reliability for the AT items and critical design decisions that contributed to validity evidence. Implications: An important contribution of this work is the inclusion of spatial reasoning in our definition of early childhood CT.

Method: We examined the portfolios of 248 high school students in 15 introductory CS classrooms from largely underserved communities, using a formal rubric (top-down) to code computational communication and an open-coding scheme (bottom-up) to identify computational practices described. Findings: Students demonstrated stronger abilities to communicate about computation using text than visuals. They also reported under-assessed CT practices like debugging, iterating, and collaborating. Students of experienced e-textile teachers performed substantially better than those with novice e-textile teachers. Implications: Portfolios provide a viable addition to traditional performance or survey assessments and meet a need to promote communication skills.

10.1007/s10956-019-09794-8,"Computational thinking (CT) is believed to be a critical factor to facilitate STEM learning, and a vital learning objective itself. Therefore, researchers are continuing to explore effective ways to improve and assess it. Makerspaces feature various hands-on activities, which can attract students with diverse interests from different backgrounds. If well designed, scaffolded maker activities have the potential to improve students' CT skills and STEM learning. In this study, we explore ways to improve and assess physics and engineering integrated CT skills through developing maker activities and assessments, which are applicable in both informal and formal educational settings. Our paper presents our work on improving and assessing CT in maker activities with two primary goals. First, it introduces the maker activities and instruments we developed to improve and assess CT that are integrated in physics and engineering learning. Second, it presents the students' CT skill and disposition change from pretest to posttest in two summer academies with CT enhanced maker activities, which was respectively led by after school educators and formal educators in a public library.

10.1002/hbe2.224,"Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental skill, like math, for all students. This need to equip every student with competent CT skills calls for CT education in K‐12 schools and teachers with adequate content and pedagogical knowledge to integrate CT. This study elicits and synthesis what top leaders in CT education know and experience about best practices of CT in K‐12 schools and educator preparation. It also examines experts' views about distinctive challenges, useful strategies, and practical models related to CT education. Adopting an expert interview approach, the participants are five leaders with diverse background and extensive experience in the field of CT education. The qualitative analysis of the data points to two guidelines to teach CT in K‐12 context, namely age level appropriateness and good design. It also indicates three main challenges and specific strategies to establish CT‐integrated teacher education programs.

10.1007/s10956-019-09804-9,"Synergistic learning combining computational thinking (CT) and STEM has proven to be an effective method for advancing learning and understanding in a number of STEM domains and simultaneously helping students develop important CT concepts and practices. We adopt a design-based approach to develop, evaluate, and refine our Collaborative, Computational STEM (C2STEM) learning environment. The system adopts a novel paradigm that combines visual model building with a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) to scaffold learning of high school physics using a computational modeling approach. In this paper, we discuss the design principles that guided the development of our open-ended learning environment (OELE) using a learning-by-modeling and evidence-centered approach for curriculum and assessment design. Students learn by building models that describe the motion of objects, and their learning is supported by scaffolded tasks and embedded formative assessments that introduce them to physics and CT concepts. We have also developed preparation for future learning (PFL) assessments to study students' abilities to generalize and apply CT and science concepts and practices across problem solving tasks and domains. We use mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to analyze student learning during a semester-long study run in a high school physics classroom. We document some of the lessons learned from this study and discuss directions for future work.

To increase the number and diversity of students engaging in computer science, young children need opportunities to develop interest and foundational understandings, including computational thinking (CT). Accordingly, elementary teachers need to understand CT, and how to integrate it into their practice. We investigate how to best support elementary teachers in learning to integrate CT into their science teaching through a CT professional development experience for elementary teachers. The professional development consisted of two parts: a professional development workshop and a science teacher inquiry group. In this study, we sought to understand if and how teachers' views on integrating CT into their teaching practice changed following their participation in a yearlong professional development experience on CT. Based on our analysis, we offer suggestions for future research and implications for the design of professional development for integrating CT into science education.

10.1109/TE.2019.2925253,"Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers’ knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers’ coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants’ reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants’ written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers’ reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.

It draws concepts and techniques such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation and iteration from computer and information science, but has broad application in the arts, sciences, humanities and social sciences. This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals. A better understanding of each mode can enrich what we teach aspiring information professionals about computational and critical thinking, how we teach it, and how we apply these skills in our professional work.

10.3390/math9182219,"In recent years, with the flourishing of the catering economy and the trends in computer technology, restaurant operators have increasingly relied on employees with computational and information skills. Breaking through the traditional teaching method of mere lecturing, the study conducts a teaching demonstration by integrating the computational thinking concept and a Microsoft Excel computational system on the school's E-learning platform into the teaching of a Culinary and Restaurant Management course. A non-equivalent control group pretest–posttest study with a quasi-experimental design is adopted for the assignment of experimental participants and the design of the course. The results show that a curriculum design with computational thinking significantly improves the effectiveness of students' learning in digital technology and is especially helpful for the cultivation of the key capabilities of menu design and cost planning among restaurant management skills. The study makes the following contributions: during the Culinary and Restaurant Management course, the use of the E-learning platform and computing programs such as Microsoft Excel is associated with greater learning effectiveness than traditional teaching methods. The research results can serve as a reference for promoting an E-catering business model and a sustainable educational model in the future.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003897,"We join the increasing call to take computational education of life science students a step further, beyond teaching mere programming and employing existing software tools. We describe a new course, focusing on enriching the curriculum of life science students with abstract, algorithmic, and logical thinking, and exposing them to the computational “culture.” The design, structure, and content of our course are influenced by recent efforts in this area, collaborations with life scientists, and our own instructional experience. Specifically, we suggest that an effective course of this nature should: (1) devote time to explicitly reflect upon computational thinking processes, resisting the temptation to drift to purely practical instruction, (2) focus on discrete notions, rather than on continuous ones, and (3) have basic programming as a prerequisite, so students need not be preoccupied with elementary programming issues. We strongly recommend that the mere use of existing bioinformatics tools and packages should not replace hands-on programming. Yet, we suggest that programming will mostly serve as a means to practice computational thinking processes. This paper deals with the challenges and considerations of such computational education for life science students. It also describes a concrete implementation of the course and encourages its use by others.

10.3390/math12111655,"Programming is acknowledged widely as a cornerstone skill in Computer Science education. Despite significant efforts to refine teaching methodologies, a segment of students is still at risk of failing programming courses. It is crucial to identify potentially struggling students at risk of underperforming or academic failure. This study explores the predictive potential of students' problem-solving skills through dynamic, domain-independent, complex problem-solving assessment. To evaluate the predictive potential of complex problem-solving empirically, a case study with 122 participants was conducted in the undergraduate Introductory Programming Course at the University of Maribor, Slovenia. A latent variable approach was employed to examine the associations. The study results showed that complex problem-solving has a strong positive effect on performance in Introductory Programming Courses. According to the results of structural equation modeling, 64% of the variance in programming performance is explained by complex problem-solving ability. Our findings indicate that complex problem-solving performance could serve as a significant, cognitive, dynamic predictor, applicable to the Introductory Programming Course. Moreover, we present evidence that the demonstrated approach could also be used to predict success in the broader computing education community, including K-12, and the wider education landscape. Apart from predictive potential, our results suggest that valid and reliable instruments for assessing complex problem-solving could also be used for assessing general-purpose, domain-independent problem-solving skills in computing education. Likewise, the results confirmed the positive effect of previous programming experience on programming performance. On the other hand, there was no significant direct effect of performance in High School mathematics on Introductory Programming.

First, when we speak about modelling to support the learning of probability, I wondered about the confusion that may exist for readers trying to digest the various nuances presented and suggest a possible simplification. Second, because of the complexity of computational modelling and the variety of potential computational tools available, I suggest attention to computational thinking, instrumental genesis, and dynamic technology scaffolding as we consider productive learning trajectories for teachers and students and offer a specific example for consideration. Finally, with guarded optimism, I address some challenges of scaling up practices and ideas from ongoing research in support of teacher learning and look forward to continued productive research opportunities.

,"Computational devices are an integral part of our daily lives that underpin our social, political, and economic livelihood. The field of computer science has the potential to be an equalizing force if all members of society have the opportunity to participate in it. For example, there is a growing influence of automation, specifically technologies that involve artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), on transforming the way we live and work. Reflecting this growing influence, there is also an increased demand for individuals with skills and knowledge to navigate an AI/ML-enhanced workplace. However, there remains a disparity between those able to benefit from such changes in workforce demands. As such, finding ways to address this disparity is not only an imperative towards a more diverse and representative workforce, but also has the potential to foster untapped talent in engineering and other STEM fields. In an effort to fulfill this need, Curated Pathway to Innovation (CPI) has been designed to develop and maintain students' interest and engagement in computer science and programming through a personalized online educational platform powered by machine learning. Data collected thus far from CPI users suggests an increase in attitudes towards computer programming after one year of using the platform which did not vary between users based on demographic factors. The benefits and challenges of addressing issues related to equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging in the computing sector through a platform such as CPI are further considered.

10.22381/kc11220237,"The incursion of tech companies into wider aspects of our lives means that computational thinking has become increasingly enmeshed with physiological, emotional, creative and social aspects of human life. We suggest that advanced computational thinking should be considered in wider terms than the limited scope of computer sciences and that we should recognise the expansion of the 'computer world' and its incursion into lived life: the pervasive encroachment of technology into physical, emotional, spatial, culturally complex and, strictly speaking, non-logical areas of our lives. The proposal is that we use a new term, advanced computational thinking, with the appropriate and relevant acronym of ACT, to suggest a social performative bias to existing ideas of computational thinking in education. The expansion of the computer world is the backdrop for exploring thinking as a 'kinship' with things (thing-kin) traversing human and material forms. In this article, ACT engages with the cultural scaffolding of the makerSpace, supporting a thinking space where kinship between 'things' and makers promotes diversity of learning style and an idea of epistemological pluralism. By recognising thinking and things as being closely entangled with sociomaterial realms, advanced computational thinking incorporates the wider social consequences of technology: expanding early definitions of computational thinking as tools exclusively focused on mathematical, logical or algorithmic thinking.

In addition, much of the research on CT has focused on creating generally agreed-upon definitions and curricula, but few studies have empirically tested assessments or used contemporary learning sciences methods to do so. In this paper, we outline the implementation of an assessment approach for a 10-day high school biology unit with computational thinking activities that examines student pre-post responses as well as responses to embedded assessments throughout the unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group's CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that (1) students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a science unit with computational models and (2) that the use of embedded assessments and discourse analytics tools reveals how students think differently with computational tools throughout the unit.

We studied the associations between these two constructs among middle school students (N = 57), considering two types of creativity: a general creative thinking, and a specific computational creativity. We did so using learning analytics, specifically, by operationalizing a log-based assessment of computational creativity. We find some evidence for an association between Computational Creativity and Computational Thinking: Demonstrating originality in an early stage of the game is associated with succeeding in this stage relatively easily, however negatively associated with progressing farther in the game. We also find that Computational Creativity is better explained by a state- rather than a trait-model. No associations were found between Creative Thinking and Computational Thinking. Furthermore, we find some striking associations between the two measures of creativity.

This research study focused on three specific exhibit design approaches that conveyed problem decomposition content in The Science Behind Pixar (Pixar), a 13,000 square foot traveling exhibition about the computer science, mathematics, and science behind Pixar's innovative films. Phase One investigated how novice learners could be supported to interact with exhibits and understand problem solving strategies that tackle complex, creative challenges in computer programming. Phase Two investigated the affordances of these exhibits to build capacity, feelings of efficacy, and interest in problem decomposition content in middle and high school youth. The findings in this paper describe the types of scaffolds that can be used to support computational thinking in novice youth, as well as how a combination of exhibit approaches were found to increase youth perceptions, understanding, and beliefs of computer programming. It will also discuss how two exhibit approaches worked particularly well for engaging girls in problem decomposition content.

Unfortunately, in many cases, it is implemented as an individual written report that has little to do with improving learners' digital competence or Computational Thinking skills. In the new national curriculum (to be in force from 2023), an alternative model is proposed for creative project work inspired by how the software development teams are working today: agile, collaborative design, rapid prototyping, and emphatic involvement of the target group. This paper introduces the process and the results of design-based research aimed at prototyping and piloting a set of learning resources (templates, tutorials, examples, etc.) for the redefined, collaborative creative project.

10.1007/s11423-023-10240-1,"Computational thinking (CT) has become an important skill for the new generation, and CT teaching games have been introduced to lower the barriers that novices face in learning programming. However, despite the prevalence of and demand for these games, little is known about the effectiveness of their design or about the principles that are conducive to learning using these games. In this article, we present a project in which we triangulated design research with controlled experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of a computational puzzle design (CPD) framework in guiding the development of CT teaching games for children. Using CT tests, game logs, and a survey, we evaluated the learning outcomes of and engagement with various versions of the game LittleWorld, designed based on various principles of the CPD framework and implemented in Chinese elementary education (n = 202). The results validate the CPD framework and demonstrate that it is a practical and systematic tool for designing CT teaching games. The findings of this study provide design implications concerning (1) the application of meta-gaming and (2) how serious game design research should be conducted.

10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104961,"In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (d ppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (d ppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (d ppc2 = 0.17, d ppc2 = 0.20). • Structured virtual and educational robotics activities improve younger children's EFs and problem solving. • Unstructured virtual coding activities are effective in boosting the problem solving skills of older students. • Coding interventions improve higher order EFs, more than elementary EFs. • The largest effects of coding interventions are observed on problem-solving.

10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104794,"Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities. • This study used student-generated questions (SGQ) in game-based learning platform. • This study integrated five core competencies of computational thinking into SGQ. • This result indicated that SGQ enhanced student's computational thinking skills. • It was studied that SGQ could improve student's learning motivation and confidence. • This study confirmed the contribution of SGQ to computational thinking skills.

However, computation is not well represented in high school and university curricula in science and engineering, although it applies to a wide range of disciplines beyond computer science and software engineering. In light of the increasing need to provide students with computational education, this paper presents a novel way to develop computational thinking among students. The proposed approach is based on the implementation of Papert's theory of constructionism in electronic spreadsheets. In this approach, students build their knowledge while constructing the difference equation that describes a physical (or engineering) phenomenon, based on specific cases investigated in the spreadsheet. The method does not require the students to write code or perform complex calculations in the spreadsheet and makes it possible to teach advanced subjects at a relatively early stage. The method is demonstrated through contents taken from the secondary and tertiary curricula in mechanics and electromagnetism.

We designed a professional development activity for elementary teachers to embed CT within science and examined how their understanding of CT emerged over the course of PD. This paper reports results from qualitative analysis of teacher responses to vignettes and open-ended questions, which presented teaching scenarios related to CT. We found that the vignettes allow us to see shift in teachersâ€™ thinking about CT from broad and generalized ideas to more elaborate versions of those ideas. We discuss that while vignettes provided a good method to portray changes in teacher views about CT, we need additional mechanisms to monitor how teachers conceptualize and come to integrate computational thinking into elementary schools.

10.1016/j.compedu.2018.08.026,"Abstract Building on Seymour Papert's view of empowering students by mastering programming, this study conceptualized programming empowerment as consisting of four components: meaningfulness, impact, creative self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy. A sample of 287 primary school students in grades four to six completed a corresponding survey. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. A structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. Also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. Boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. Students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy. These results support future studies that evaluate the impacts of interest-driven computational thinking and programming curricula with ample collaboration opportunities. Highlights • Empowerment consists of meaningfulness, impact, creative and programming self-efficacy. • The study validated the programming empowerment instrument. • Students with greater interest in programming perceive greater empowerment. • Students with positive collaboration attitude have greater creative self-efficacy. • Students in senior grades viewed programming as less meaningful than junior grades.

However, research on assessing CT has lagged, with few assessments being implemented and validated. Moreover, there is a lack of systematic grouping of CT assessments. This scoping review examines 39 empirical studies published within the last five years, coded by the specific competencies outlined in existing CT frameworks, to identify and classify the key features of existing CT assessments. Results show that most studies target K-12 settings, focus on interventions that promote CT concepts and practices, adopt a quasi-experimental design, use selected-response items as the dominant testing form, and mainly assess algorithmic thinking, abstraction, problem decomposition, logical thinking, and data. Finally, few CT assessments have been validated in educational settings. Implications include identifying gaps in the CT assessment literature, deepening our understanding of the nature of CT, focusing on the validation of CT assessments, and guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing developmentally appropriate CT assessments. Cognitive and educational implications for future research inquiry include the development of new assessment tools that comprehensively assess CT and its relation to learning.

Research on computational thinking (CT) integration in school subjects and STEAM activities has shown a positive effect on students’ problem-solving skills and creativity. Our study extends our previous work from the integration of CT in a mathematics lesson into a STEAM lesson to develop students’ creativity. Our Math + CT activities have been developed through educational design research (EDR), and now we have added the context of arts (Batik), science (beeswax and coloring), and engineering (3D modeling and printing). Online learning was conducted with pre-service teachers and high school students. We facilitated digital fabrication by asking students and pre-service teachers to create their Batik stamp pattern from 2D to 3D to be printed. Data were collected from participants’ GeoGebra and 3D files they had created. We analyzed the data descriptively and presented participants’ creations. The result showed that students could extend their limited coding and programming knowledge to create the Batik patterns. Moreover, within a limited time, the artwork they designed significantly differs from the initial figure introduced to them. We also presented the realistic 3D-printed Batik stamp and how it worked and our limitations.

,"The slogan ""by teaching programming, abstraction capacity is developed"" played a key role in the acceptance of the incorporation of programming teaching in schools. it should be noted that the role of abstraction in Computing is central, to the point of being conceptualized as ""the art of abstraction"". But, is it the same abstraction that psychology teaches? To answer this question, we reviewed the literature from both fields and found intrafield and interfield heterogeneity. While in the field of psychology the piagetian influence makes the association between abstraction, generalization and fluid intelligence very strong, in the field of computer science this association is not present. it is treated as a very powerful but much more specific tool, with at least three different meanings. Based on them and on previous bibliography, we outline a mathematization proposal to clarify their differences.

To reflect modern practice and technologies, they emphasize giving students experience with multivariable thinking. Students develop multivariable thinking when they analyze real data in the context of investigating research questions of interest, which typically involve complex relationships between many variables. Proficiency in a statistical programming language facilitates the development of multivariable thinking by giving students tools to investigate complex data on their own. However, learning a programming language in an introductory course is difficult for many students. In this article, we recommend a set of computational skills for introductory courses, demonstrate them using R tidyverse, and describe a classroom activity to develop computational skills and multivariable thinking. We provide a tidyverse tutorial for introductory students, our course guide, and classroom activities.

This research aims to characterize future kindergarten teachers' traits of didactic-mathematical and computational knowledge presented when solving and posing robotics problems. Firstly, aspects of the mathematical and computational knowledge of the participants (97 students of the subject of Didactics of Mathematics of the Degree in Early Childhood Education at a Spanish university) were identified when they solved problems as users of the Blue-Bot didactic robot. Secondly, we analyzed their justifications for reflecting on the design of robotics problems. The results indicate that future teachers present characteristics of didactic-mathematical knowledge when solving and designing robotics problems, although errors and ambiguities are evident, especially in the procedures and representations of the programming. These shortcomings significantly influence the didactic suitability of the robotics problems they design. From a future perspective, in the training of future teachers, it is considered relevant to incorporate didactic-mathematical and computational knowledge that allows them to develop logical, spatial and computational thinking.

10.1016/j.jecp.2023.105738,"• The teaching of computational thinking in school children, in addition to improving computer skills, is expected to improve other higher cognitive processes, such as executive functions. • Computational thinking training in school children improved performance in visuospatial working memory, sequential planning, and cognitive inhibition. • Computational thinking training showed no effects on verbal working memory and visuospatial planning. The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children's cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the ""Programming for Children"" program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

It was forecasted that, in the next few years, half of the jobs in science, mathematics, technology and engineering (abbreviated as STEM, including arts as STEAM) will use some kind of computation. It is therefore necessary to enhance the learning of mathematics by collaborative problem-solving activities focused on both learning mathematics and developing computational thinking. The problems in science offer a reasonable context in which to investigate the common overarching concepts (e.g., measuring the length). An interdisciplinary STEAM collaborative problem-solving activity was designed and piloted with 27 lower secondary students aged 13.07 ± 1.21 years. Different levels of willingness to use the technology were observed and the factors influencing it were identified. We found that strong background knowledge implies high demands when controlling the used device. On the other hand, when a nice and user-friendly application was used, students did not need to perceive any control over it. After the intervention, the students' views on the tablet changed and they reported more STEAM-related functions of the device.

10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.030,"Computational thinking (CT) is being consolidated as a key set of problem-solving skills that must be developed by the students to excel in our software-driven society. However, in psychological terms, CT is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. In a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between CT and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and some additional self-efficacy items are administered on a sample of 1251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade ( N = 1251), and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) is also taken by a subsample from the above ( n = 99). Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and self-efficacy perception relative to CT performance ( r s = 0.41), in which gender differences in favor of males are found ( d = 0.42). Moreover, results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience ( r = 0.41), Extraversion ( r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness ( r = 0.27). These findings are consistent with the existing literature except for the unexpected correlation between CT and the Extraversion factor of personality, which is consequently discussed in detail. Overall, our findings corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT that should be taken into account by educational policies and interventions aimed at fostering CT. As a final contribution, the extended nomological network of CT integrating cognitive and non-cognitive variables is depicted.

,"Informal learning environments such as science centers and museums are instrumental in the promotion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. These settings provide children with the chance to engage in self-directed activities that can create lifelong interest and persistence in STEM. In addition, the participation of parents in these settings can engage children in conversations that can boost understanding and enhance learning of STEM topics. To date, a considerable amount of research has focused on adult-child dialogue. Findings from those studies revealed that children experience more elaborate scientific thinking when parents facilitate learning. Given the need for engineers to have computer science skills, academic discourse has placed emphasis on studying computational thinking (CT) in children. While some recent studies have focused on the roles parents play to promote children's engineering thinking, very few studies have explored parents' influence on children's engagement in CT. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the roles that parents play in promoting computational thinking in their young children. In this study, families of 5-7 year-old children were invited to a science center. The families were asked to interact with an exhibit, ""Computing for the Critters,"" that was designed to promote engineering and computational thinking in children. We conducted a qualitative case study to closely examine child-parent interactions during one portion of the exhibit that is a computerbased coding game. Drawing on previous literature from engineering education and informal science education, a coding scheme was developed with the essential roles that parents play in science centers and museums. The roles include Supervising, Co-learning, Facilitating, Encouragement and Student of the Child. In this study, we have observed that parents take multiple roles in which some of them resulted in children's enactment of CTs. The findings of this study advance our understanding of how parents can support computational thinking while engaging in conversations during engineering activities.

,"In recent years, computational thinking has received increasing amounts of attention, with numerous K-12 institutions looking to incorporate it into existing STEM curriculums. This movement to improve computational thinking literacy, supported by numerous professional organizations (e.g., American Society for Engineering Education [ASEE], National Research Council [NRC], National Academy of Engineering [NAE]) and Next Generation Science Standard (NGSS Lead States, 2013), attempts to improve students' problem-solving skills and strategies. Efforts to improve computational thinking have been aimed at both teachers and students. However, few studies exist to investigate how teachers implement the teaching of CT practices in courses with a component that involves collaboration between students in multiple countries. Therefore, the focus of the study is to explore middle school STEM teachers' understandings of computational thinking practices, if any, within an integrated STEM education teaching approach. This study is an international study, as the teachers are from two countries, Brazil and the United States. For this study, an extensive semi-structured interview protocol is used to gather data from a sample of four middle school STEM teachers. All of the teachers are communicated with in English to collect the data. A case study method is implemented to collect and analyze interview data to identify similarities across cases. Member checking is used to confirm accuracy in the results. Findings from this study offer insights for researchers, middle school teachers, curriculum developers and professional development providers.

,"Computational Thinking (CT) is an often overlooked, but important, aspect of engineering thinking. This connection can be seen in Wing's definition of CT, which includes a combination of mathematical and engineering thinking required to solve problems. While previous studies have shown that children are capable of engaging in multiple CT competencies, research has yet to explore the role that parents play in promoting these competencies in their children. In this study, we are taking a unique approach by investigating the role that a homeschool mother played in her child's engagement in CT. This qualitative case study of a homeschool family is comprised of a mother and her six-year-old daughter. They engaged in two STEM+C activities designed by our research team. The parent first utilized the integrated STEM+C+literacy curriculum at home, and then visited a local science center. During their visit, both the parent and child interacted with an exhibit designed to promote engineering and computational thinking among children. Their engagement in both activities was video- and audio-recorded. Interviews regarding their experience were also conducted at the end of each activity (curriculum and exhibit participation). In this study, we employed a video analysis approach to examine childparent interactions and utilized a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interviews. Our findings suggest that homeschool parents are integral to supporting children's understanding of CT.

10.1007/s10606-017-9292-y,"Computational algorithmic thinking (CAT) is the ability to design, implement, and assess the implementation of algorithms to solve a range of problems. It involves identifying and understanding a problem, articulating an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, implementing that solution in such a way that the solution solves the problem, and evaluating the solution based on some set of criteria. CAT is an important scaffolded on-ramp as students develop more advanced computational thinking capabilities and apply computational thinking to solve problems that are more constrained and require greater expertise. Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) is both a longitudinal between-subjects research project and a free enrichment program supporting and guiding African-American middle school girls over three years as they iteratively design a set of complex games for social change. This article explores Scholars' reflections about the difficulties they faced while using CAT capabilities as they engaged in collaborative game design for social change over those three years. We particularly focus on how these difficulties changed over the course of three years as well as new difficulties that emerged from year to year as Scholars become more expert game designers and computational algorithmic thinkers.

,"Considering the difficulties in the teaching/learning process of computerprogramming, the development of skills related to Computational Thinking (CT) toprepare people to better solve problems stands out. Augmented Reality (AR) allows for the insertion and interaction with virtual information in the real world. AR is becoming ordinary to humanity, including the design of new teaching/learning strategies that enable the creation of metaphors with virtual information. In this way, it can be said that AR provides a framework for the creation of analogies of complex concepts facilitating their comprehension. This article describes an interactive way of understanding computer instructions (a program) tomanipulate data structures (lists, stacks, and queues). The objective of this study is to useAugmented Reality to visualize high-level program statements through a mobile animation system. User instructions are animated in real-time creating virtual 3D representations to help understand operations that handle abstract data-structures used in classic programming. This approach contributes substantially to the construction of educational resources aimed at supporting novice programmers that face critical difficulties to learn adequately Computer Programming. The work described here shows that with effective AR-based Learning Resources, it is possibleto train skills such as analyzing, representing information, planning strategies, andsystematizing resolution schemes, that are crucial to solve problems.

10.1080/0047231x.2020.12290665,"With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), assessing K-12 science teachers' self-efficacy in Computational Thinking (CT) is an important research gap to study. Bandura defines self-efficacy as awareness of the individual's potential and capabilities to accomplish a goal. Teaching efficacy beliefs is a significant identifier of teachers' performance and motivation in teaching the specific content successfully; however, K-12 science teachers' CT teaching efficacy beliefs are rarely discussed. Participating preservice elementary teachers (PSET) were enrolled in an undergraduate elementary science teaching methods course during the spring and summer 2018 semesters in a southwestern state university. We administered a CT teaching efficacy beliefs survey at the beginning and end of the related unit (i.e., the intervention). During the intervention, the PSET followed the CT practices by building educational robots, coding visual block-based programs, and solving puzzles in the video game ""Zoombinis."" In this paper, we report the impact of the intervention on teaching efficacy beliefs of PSET. We used SPSS software to analyze our quantitative results. We performed paired samples t-test for the two teaching efficacy beliefs subscales, Personal Computational Thinking Teaching Efficacy (PCTTE) and Computational Thinking Teaching Outcome Expectancy (CTTOE), to measure if there is a significant difference in teaching efficacy beliefs. Our research findings suggest that introducing CT increases PSET CT teaching efficacy beliefs. Furthermore, based on the results of our exploratory research with PSET, we propose implications of the study for K-12 CT teaching efficacy beliefs and CT education research.

10.30191/ETS.202401_27(1).RP08,"This study investigated the effect of video lecture types on the performance of students in computational problem-solving practices. A total of 19 university students participated in the computational problem-solving practices that mostly required declarative knowledge, and 22 university students participated in the computational problem-solving practices that mostly required procedural knowledge. The practices were implemented in the Algorithm and Programming course and the Computer Programming II course. Three video lecture types (instructor-whiteboard, instructor voice-handbook, instructor-slides) were used in both courses. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA test was employed to determine if there was a significant difference between the problem-solving performances of the students based on the video lecture type. In the Algorithm and Programming course that required mostly declarative knowledge, the problem-solving scores of the students were significantly higher after the instructor voice-handbook video practice than those after the instructorwhiteboard video practice. On the other hand, in the Computer Programming II course that required mostly procedural knowledge, the problem-solving scores of the students were significantly higher after the instructorwhiteboard video practice than those after the instructor voice-handbook video practice. The students showed higher performance in the video lecture types they preferred in both courses. The students listed the factors that affect their video preferences as (a) the effect of the presence of an instructor in the video lecture on their attention, (b) the efficiency of the video lecture in examining many and various examples in a limited time, (c) the opportunity provided by the video lecture to revise the content and procedure, and (d) the efficient presentation of the knowledge. It is recommended that an instructor should be present in the video that includes mostly procedural knowledge, while there is no need for an instructor in the video that includes mostly declarative knowledge regarding computational problem-solving activities.

A total of 81 teachers from West Virginia, Georgia, and Oklahoma participated in this survey study. Overall, teachers found CT and CT tools useful and relevant to their teaching and had access to an essential level of technology in schools supporting computational thinking. However, teachers' CT skills and their teaching of CT were limited and varied depending on rurality and grade level. For instance, primary school teachers in rural settings reported significantly lower levels of CT skills than those in urban settings. Findings and implications are discussed.

10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.025,"Learning Computational Thinking concepts by all has gained quite importance in last years. Scratch is also one of the most used products to promote it worldwide. Yet, most teachers face difficulties when using it in the classroom with their students. With this idea in mind we developed and run a distance education course under the Project of Distance Education of the University of Coimbra specially designed for elementary school teachers to learn both Computational Thinking concepts and Scratch via an e-learning course using Moodle as a Learning Management System. In this paper we describe this first experience of teaching and learning online, the results obtained and also our future work about this course. Results of this first experience showed that it was possible for the trainees to learn Computational Thinking concepts and Scratch programming and also to develop useful products for their classroom practice using this modality of teaching and learning. As such, a second edition of the course is already planned to take place shortly.

10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0013,"In this study, we have proposed and implemented a sequential data analytics (SDA)-driven methodological framework to design adaptivity for digital game-based learning (DGBL). The goal of this framework is to facilitate children's personalized learning experiences for K-5 computing education. Although DGBL experiences can be beneficial, young children need personalized learning support because they are likely to experience cognitive challenges in computational thinking (CT) development and learning transfer. We implemented the educational game Penguin Go to test our methodological framework to detect children's optimal learning interaction patterns. Specifically, using SDA, we identified children's diverse gameplay patterns and inferred their learning states related to CT. To better understand children's gameplay performance and CT development in context, we used qualitative data as triangulation. We discuss adaptivity design based on the children's gameplay challenges indicated by their gameplay sequence patterns. This study shows that SDA can inform what in-game support is necessary to foster student learning and when to deliver such support in gameplay. The study findings suggest design guidelines regarding the integration of the proposed SDA framework.

Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions. • The Design-Based Implementation Research approach highlighted library staff needs by seeking sustainable solutions. • Participating in Computational Thinking (CT) assessment design led staff to focus on learning outcomes. • Involving multiple stakeholders yielded a broad understanding of CT outcomes, challenges, and programmatic needs. • Iterating with library staff allowed staff to shape the assessment tools to fit their needs.

Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies, 4(3), 1181–1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.

We examined culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), culturally responsive teaching outcome expectancy (CRTOE) beliefs, and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) as teachers participated in one of three treatment groups: robotics only, game design only, or blended robotics/game design. Descriptive data revealed that CRTSE gain scores were higher in the robotics only and blended contexts than in the game design only context. However, CRTOE beliefs were consistent across all treatment groups. In regard to CT attitudes, teachers’ gain scores were higher in the game design only and blended contexts than in the robotics only context. In addition, there were differences by treatment group related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) practices, while cultural artifacts were evident in each learning environment.

In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students' code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects' code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.

10.3390/fi11120263,"After a lengthy debate within the scientific community about what constitutes the problem solving approach of computational thinking (CT), the focus shifted to enable the integration of CT within compulsory education. This publication strives to focus the discussion and enable future research in an educational setting with a strong focus on the Austrian circumstances and the goal to allow wide international adoption later on. Methodically, a literature review was conducted to gain knowledge about the current strands of research and a meta study to show the diversity of proposed and materialized studies. Three main questions were answered, establishing that CT as an idea is rooted in scientific literature dating back to the 1980s and grew in popularity after Wing introduced the concept to a broader audience. A number of authors contributed to the current state of the field, with the most cited review coming from Grover and Pea. The challenge to integrate CT in curricula around the world was met by many experiments and case studies but without a conclusive framework as of yet. Ultimately, this paper determines that expert integration is a blank spot in the literature and aims to create a strong, inclusive path to CT education by inviting practitioners.

,"Computational Thinking is a term to group skills for the utilization of computers as problem solving tools that improves college readiness and increases K12 students' likelihood of attending and graduating from college. It differentiates from Digital Literacy (or Computer Literacy) where a person acquires skills for using the computer for everyday use. Statistics about the percentage of bachelor's degrees in computer science/engineering earned in the United States during the last twenty years shows that less than 20 percent of graduates account for underrepresented minorities which place this population in great disadvantage with other ethnic groups. Given that New Mexico is a state with high percentage of underrepresented minorities, the Department of Engineering at Northern New Mexico College through the support of Google Inc. and the National Science Foundation has organized and developed Computational Thinking (CT) workshops and activities for K12 teachers and preservice teachers during the last two years as an approach to increase the awareness of Computer Science among K12 students in New Mexico. The curriculum developed in the workshops have provided teachers and preservice teachers a variety of tools to incorporate and enhance their classes in K12 schools through the utilization of computational thinking activities. The approach utilized for the workshops has not only enhanced CT skills but also has provided ideas to develop lesson plans and activities for the Common Core State Standards. The present paper presents a summary of the activities developed for the workshops as well as results that the participants have shared on the utilization of the acquired skills in their classrooms.

,"When President Obama unveiled his plan to give all students in America the opportunity to learn computer science [1], discussions about Computational Thinking (CT) began in earnest in many organizations across a wide range of disciplines. However, Jeannette Wing stated the importance of CT for everyone a decade earlier in her landmark essay [2]. Since then, several people and organizations have posted their own definition of CT, which presents a challenge in being able to assess CT understanding and awareness in people. In an effort to build consensus on how to best assess CT, the authors have developed a web-based tool that will enable CT experts globally to populate, review and rate questions that address various attributes of CT. TECHFIT (Teaching Engineering Concepts to Harness Future Innovators and Technologists) is an NSF-funded project that is examining the impact of their program's educational intervention based on the participants' delivery context. The CT tool was designed and developed as a functional, web-based tool that supports management of the CT questions database and gives different levels of access to various stakeholders, including the TECHFIT project team and academicians all over the world. The CT tool includes features to enable authorized users to review, insert, and update a variety of questions in different formats. The level of access to this system is determined by the roles/ permissions granted by the administrator. It also enables users to have the ability to rate the questions. The ratings are then aggregated to yield an overall rating value. Attendees of the paper presentation will be invited to sign up and explore this tool to provide feedback for improvement of the tool.

,"Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in pre-college settings is seen as critical in providing opportunities for children to develop knowledge, skills, and interests in these subjects and the associated critical thinking skills. More recently computational thinking (CT) has been called out as an equally important topic to emphasize among pre-college students. The authors of this paper began an integrated STEM+CT project three years ago to explore integrating these subjects and literacy in a curriculum for 5-8-year-old students. We reported on the development of this project and an analysis of how the existing curriculum highlighted CT knowledge and skills, and how we expected the curriculum to engage students in CT in an ASEE conference paper in 2016. This paper reports on the evolution of the project and curriculum. Part of this evolution included the defining of CT and its associated competencies and what it would look like for this young age group. In this paper, we discuss this evolution as well as how we have operationalized the competencies with data from classroom testing. At the outset of this project, there were few resources that specifically considered teaching CT with 5-8-year-old children and fewer clear examples of what it looked like for children to engage in CT. However, there were many, sometimes competing, definitions and approaches to CT more generally. After further review of the literature and classroom testing of our revised curriculum, the team developed definitions for the following CT competencies: abstraction; algorithms and procedures; automation; data collection; data analysis; data representation; debugging/troubleshooting; problem decomposition; parallelization; simulation; and pattern recognition. Analysis of hundreds of students and tens of teachers implementing the curriculum allowed us to develop concrete examples of how students engage in CT competencies as well as how kindergarten through second grade teachers foster CT competency development. We report on these examples and how they informed the development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum.

,"Students are learning to interact with, design for, and sometimes even program computers at earlier and earlier ages. Teachers and researchers can relatively easily measure progress in learning programming tasks, but assessing conceptual understanding of computation, mainly when programming tasks are not present, is less defined or non-existent. Computational Thinking (CT) generally refers to knowledge and skills apart from, and possibly a precursor to, the ability to write computer programs, yet is commonly measured through the quality of programming. Are there ways of qualifying CT 'maturity' outside of programming tasks? This study looks at the intersection of CT and CS in first-grade learners who are developing computational solutions involving literacy tasks. Students retell a story by animating characters in Scratch Jr. by breaking down the story, creating an animation storyboard, and finally implementing the plan in Scratch Jr. For most of the participants, this is their first time using Scratch Jr. or any programming language. Therefore, their early experience with technology means they are working on an analysis of a story using literacy skills, considering a visual representation of the story, and learning how to realize the expression of the storyline using a computer language. To better understand the general concept of CT, we analyzed video data of the students building their animated story, along with the artifacts of design and code. This qualitative data provides indicators of how their thinking progresses from little to at least working knowledge of writing a program. Using qualitative analysis, we evaluate how their initial design evolves, simplifies, or otherwise changes as the novices move from general problem solving to creating a computational solution. CT seems to be a specialized version of design and engineering design in general. Understanding how these first graders move from generally approaching a problem to a computational solution may give insight into how CT matures and the role of programming in that maturity. By capturing how a design evolves, we can suggest how CT can be 'seen' in artifacts produced that are not programming code. The goal is to find markers of CT in design and language that transcends specific programmed implementations.

Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students' cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life. • A large-scale CT intervention was designed to foster primary students' cognitive development. • A CT practices test captured students' learning trajectories of cognitive development. • The intervention identified trajectories of students' learning process across treatment and control schools. • Fidelity of longitudinal intervention was tested with three methods to probe different insights.

,"In this digital age, being computer literate and having computer science skills are essential, especially since most real-life solutions are technology-driven. Many K-12 and higher education institutions, states, and countries incorporate computational thinking (CT) into their curriculum. Although Wing describes CT as a problem-solving approach that utilizes fundamental computing concepts, which is applicable not only for scientists but everyone, most of the computational thinking instructional approaches are related to computer programming. Unfortunately, it is also unclear whether people use CT when solving non-programming problems. This study aims to answer two research questions: (1) In what ways do students use computational thinking skills when solving non-programming problems if any?; and (2) If students use CT when solving non-programming problems, in what ways do their approaches differ from computer science students? We conducted a qualitative multiple within-site case study research with three units of analysis. We recruited two students from computer science, a civil engineering student, an instructional design student, and an art student as cases, and asked them to think aloud while solving three problems. The collected think aloud data was transcribed and qualitatively coded to identify various CT skills. Our preliminary analysis of a computer science student and an art student reveals that they used various CT skills when solving all problems, and the application of CT skills was influenced by their background, experiences, and goals. Furthermore, we found that the art student was capable of utilizing various CT skills despite her lacked prior exposure to CS or CT, which shed new light on the nature of CT.

10.1111/jcal.12427,"Massive open online course (MOOC) studies have shown that precourse skills (such as precomputational thinking) and course engagement measures (such as making multiple submission attempts with assignments when the initial submission is incorrect) predict students' grade performance, yet little is known about whether these factors predict students' course retention. In applying survival analysis to a sample of more than 20,000 participants from one popular computer science MOOC, we found that students' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC. Moreover, we discovered that precomputational thinking skills, programming experience, and gender, which were previously considered to be constant predictors of students' retention, have effects that attenuate over the course milestones. This finding suggests that MOOC educators should take a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger. Lay Description: What is already known about this topicMOOCs have very low retention rates, ranging between 1% to 15%.Background and engagement factors have been shown to predict MOOC dropout.Precomputational thinking style has been shown to predict computer science performance, but no research has investigated its effect on retention in either traditional classrooms or in MOOCs.Auto‐adaptive feedback is a quickly and widely adopted assistant feature in MOOCs, particularly in computer science, but its impact on retention is not well understood.What this paper addsStudents' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC.This study identified predictors of dropout whose effects did not diminish over time, including foreign status, gaming hours on the computer, self‐reported extrovert personality, and motivation.This study discovered predictors of dropout whose effects were seen early in the course, but diminished in importance over the milestone sequence. These predictors were gender, age, precomputational thinking skills, and prior computer science experience.Implications for practice and/or policyDesign a gradual learning curve for beginners so that they can adapt to the course mindset and framework.Assure students who are frustrated in the beginning of the course that once they adapt to the course mindset, their lack of background knowledge will not define their future experience and persistence.Assisted with the auto‐adaptive feedback features, multiple trials in the course assignment can be an engaging and rewarding experience.MOOCs should develop pedagogies that explicitly encourage student to use a trial‐and‐error strategy, testing different scenarios and experimenting with different solutions, to make the most use of auto‐adaptive feedback features.MOOC educators should not only take a growth perspective towards students' knowledge and skill development, but also a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger.

10.30191/ETS.202404_27(2).RP01,"Computational thinking (CT) has attracted global research attention. However, the relationship between CT education and later aspirations in computing careers was less explored, and less attention was paid to understanding the intermediary role of computational identity. Based on social cognitive career theory, this study examined the relationships among CT learning experiences, computational identity, programming selfefficacy, and computing aspirations. Data were collected using questionnaires with 742 high school students from an urban city in China. A structural equation modeling analysis revealed the influencing factors of computing aspirations and the intermediary role of computational identity in bridging CT learning experiences to programming self-efficacy and computing aspiration. This study has implications for policies and research to further examine computational identity and understand the pathways to cultivating computing talents.

10.1016/j.jmathb.2017.06.004,"Computational thinking has become an increasingly popular notion in K-12 and college level education. Although researchers have accepted that abstraction is a central concept in computational thinking, they are quick to disagree on the meaning of it. A focus on reflective abstraction has led to the development of APOS Theory in Mathematics education. This has resulted in many cases of improved student learning in Mathematics ( Arnon et al., 2013 ). Our main aim in this paper is to construct a theoretical bridge between computational thinking and APOS Theory and show that reflective abstraction can be used in the context of computational thinking.

10.1007/s10956-016-9663-z,"The current impetus for increasing STEM in K-12 education calls for an examination of how preservice teachers are being prepared to teach STEM. This paper reports on a study that examined elementary preservice teachers' ( n = 21) self-efficacy, understanding of science concepts, and computational thinking as they engaged with robotics in a science methods course. Data collection methods included pretests and posttests on science content, prequestionnaires and postquestionnaires for interest and self-efficacy, and four programming assignments. Statistical results showed that preservice teachers' interest and self-efficacy with robotics increased. There was a statistically significant difference between preknowledge and postknowledge scores, and preservice teachers did show gains in learning how to write algorithms and debug programs over repeated programming tasks. The findings suggest that the robotics activity was an effective instructional strategy to enhance interest in robotics, increase self-efficacy to teach with robotics, develop understandings of science concepts, and promote the development of computational thinking skills. Study findings contribute quantitative evidence to the STEM literature on how robotics develops preservice teachers' self-efficacy, science knowledge, and computational thinking skills in higher education science classroom contexts.

10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112626,"Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of ""design friendliness"" and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a ""designer friendly"" working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

10.1007/s10956-016-9628-2,"This paper describes the findings of a pilot study that used robotics and game design to develop middle school students' computational thinking strategies. One hundred and twenty-four students engaged in LEGO EV3 robotics and created games using Scalable Game Design software. The results of the study revealed students' pre-post self-efficacy scores on the construct of computer use declined significantly, while the constructs of videogaming and computer gaming remained unchanged. When these constructs were analyzed by type of learning environment, self-efficacy on videogaming increased significantly in the combined robotics/gaming environment compared with the gaming-only context. Student attitudes toward STEM, however, did not change significantly as a result of the study. Finally, children's computational thinking (CT) strategies varied by method of instruction as students who participated in holistic game development (i.e., Project First) had higher CT ratings. This study contributes to the STEM education literature on the use of robotics and game design to influence self-efficacy in technology and CT, while informing the research team about the adaptations needed to ensure project fidelity during the remaining years of the study.

10.1111/jcal.12348,"Computational thinking (CT), the ability to devise computational solutions for real‐life problems, has received growing attention from both educators and researchers. To better improve university students' CT competence, collaborative programming is regarded as an effective learning approach. However, how novice programmers develop CT competence through collaborative problem solving remains unclear. This study adopted an innovative approach, quantitative ethnography, to analyze the collaborative programming activities of a high‐performing and a low‐performing team. Both the discourse analysis and epistemic network models revealed that across concepts, practices, and identity, the high‐performing team exhibited CT that was systematic, whereas the CT of the low‐performing team was characterized by tinkering or guess‐and‐check approaches. However, the low‐performing group's CT development trajectory ultimately converged towards the high‐performing group's. This study thus improves understanding of how novices learn CT, and it illustrates a useful method for modeling CT based in authentic problem‐solving contexts. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking competence includes computational concepts, computational practices, and computational perspectives.Collaborative programming has the potential to foster computational thinking competence development.What this paper adds: The low‐performing student group adopted a bottom‐up perspective at the beginning but transformed to a top‐down approach by the end.The low‐performing group's computational thinking development trajectory had convergent evolution towards the high‐performing group's trajectory.Implications for practice and/or policy: Computational thinking competence can be developed in collaborative contexts even when students begin with a bottom‐up approach.Computational thinking should go beyond the cognitive development of computational concepts to connect computational practice and computational identity.Quantitative ethnography approach has potential to model computational thinking competence in collaborative programming context.

,"In Cuba, the conception of higher education, based on professional improvement, constitutes a subsystem of postgraduate education and its objective is the permanent training of university graduates. This constitutes an opportunity to prepare professionals for the growing challenge of contemporary technological development. The educational field is not left out and therefore reconfigures aspects not previously considered, such as the introduction of educational robotics in the pedagogical process. In this context, it is necessary to approach the training of the Computer Science teacher in educational robotics from a didactic model that integrates computational thinking, visual programming and innovation. Therefore, the objective of this work is aimed at assessing the pedagogical effectiveness of the model and assessing its relevance through the use of theoretical and empirical research methods, which allowed the main scientific results to be verified.

10.1080/10632913.2021.1974996,"This study examines the underpinnings of Japan's programming education in elementary school music, officially implemented nationwide in 2020. Through that reform, which has introduced programming thinking (a local version of computational thinking) in all areas of compulsory education, the country follows the international trend of reinforcing IT skills, considered essential for employability. However, Japan's cross-curricular policy raises questions on its implications for the arts, including music. In view of that, this study presents a content analysis of 12 recent Japanese-language sources, selected for reporting about activities that integrate programming education into music in elementary schools in Japan. As part of that analysis, the main objectives of those activities are described and examined together with their approaches to programming and music learning contents. Findings reveal the apparent lack of a specific theoretical framework aimed at music learning goals, and beliefs about a certain affinity between music and programming, only partially defined. They also show tensions between flexible and fixed-goal approaches to compositional activities, as well as several interpretations of IT terms that have permeated music education, namely, algorithm and program. This suggests new roles being attributed to music as a school subject in relation to computer science, a fact that leads to discussion about the need for specific strategies, in view of challenges and goals particular to this country, such as society 5.0.

10.1080/09523987.2013.777185,"A significant area of learning design research has been the development of software applications that guide teachers’ thinking as they plan, construct and revise learning events for their students. In this paper, we review conceptualisations of, and approaches to, the activity of pedagogic design and highlight the implications for the provision of computational support for this activity. We then outline different ways in which that support has been implemented in three digital tools: Phoebe, the LAMS Activity Planner and the Learning Designer. We consider the challenges to, and implications of, deploying these tools from the perspectives of three groups of stakeholders: developers, teachers and institutions. Our findings suggest that, while such tools are acceptable in principle, they face a number of technological and socio-cultural challenges to their acceptability from teachers’ perspectives and to their deployment within institutional strategies for teaching and learning in a digital age.

10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.005,"Several countries have usually adopted several priorities for developing ICT competences from kindergarten to secondary education. Most of them are focused on the development of key competences and/or coding skills. Although coding may be very attractive for young students and a very good practice or experience, it could be more interesting to develop students' logical thinking skills and problem-solving skills throughout programming approaches or computational thinking. This is a very exciting challenge with lots of possibilities regarding coding, robots, mobiles devices, Arduino-based application, game-based learning and so on. Thus, it is very important to explore the effect that these experiences have been taking into the pre-university students, both at primary and secondary education, with a special focus on the computational thinking as one of the components inside the toolbox to develop a reflexive and critical education in order to help children to solve problems using the technology with which they will live daily.

10.1038/msb.2011.78,"Computer science and biology have enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship for decades. Biologists rely on computational methods to analyze and integrate large data sets, while several computational methods were inspired by the highlevel design principles of biological systems. Recently, these two directions have been converging. In this review,we argue that thinking computationally about biological processesmay lead to more accurate models, which in turn can be used to improve the design of algorithms. We discuss the similar mechanisms and requirements shared by computational and biological processes and then present several recent studies that apply this joint analysis strategy to problems related to coordination, network analysis, and tracking and vision. We also discuss additional biological processes that can be studied in a similar manner and link them to potential computational problems.With the rapid accumulation of data detailing the inner workings of biological systems, we expect this direction of coupling biological and computational studies to greatly expand in the future.

This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university’s educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

10.1016/j.chb.2016.08.047,"Computational thinking (CT) is being located at the focus of educational innovation, as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to thrive in a digital world full of objects driven by software. However, there is still no consensus on a CT definition or how to measure it. In response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach. On the one hand, a Computational Thinking Test (CTt) is administered on a sample of 1,251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade, so its descriptive statistics and reliability are reported in this paper. On the second hand, the criterion validity of the CTt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) battery, and the RP30 problem-solving test. Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results show statistically significant correlations at least moderately intense between CT and: spatial ability ( r = 0.44), reasoning ability ( r = 0.44), and problem-solving ability ( r = 0.67). These results are consistent with recent theoretical proposals linking CT to some components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence, and corroborate the conceptualization of CT as a problem-solving ability.

While the expansion of computational thinking acquisition (CTA) initiatives at schools and the availability of improved programming environments have contributed to facilitate the learners’ coding tasks, much less has been done to facilitate the acquisition of software quality notions. This paper reports on a Brazilian CTA program guided by semiotic principles and describes a study of how the technology used in it prefigures elements of software engineering in the participants’ programs created with AgentSheets. Our research contributions touch on the semiotic potential of CTA infrastructures and on associated pedagogical considerations for expanding CTA programs with software engineering basics.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104707,"Computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 requires extensive teacher development. This research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable teacher development programme in promoting CT in primary education. This report presents two studies. Study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor programming environments for CT development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly enhanced teachers' content-related knowledge dimensions. The results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity – learners' abilities, interests, and approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers' capabilities. However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching. • We evaluate a teacher development programme involving 245 teachers from 47 schools. • The programme enhanced the content-related knowledge of TPACK of these teachers. • We examine how the schools implement the CT initiative by visiting these 47 schools. • Common strategies include team formation, lesson co-planning, and subject integration. • Teacher readiness, lesson time & manpower, and learner diversity are major challenges.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104657,"Designing artificial intelligence (AI) artefact learning has gone beyond command-line-based instruction, to include a low-barrier threshold with block-based programming. Such instructional design must not solely emphasise AI workings. Rather, it must offer students computational thinking (CT) practice to support their AI-related artefact creation while reducing their AI anxiety about future job replacement or sociotechnical blindness. In this study, this research explored an experiential learning approach to improve CT along with AI application capabilities when engaging undergraduate students in creating a voice assistant application (VA app). A total of 56 students participated in the study. The control group (CG) of 26 students used a conventional subject-based learning method, while the experimental group (EG) of 30 students adopted an experiential learning method. This study aimed to examine the differences in the learning achievement of CT and AI concept, as well as the perspectives of AI anxiety, and CT; in the meanwhile, this study analysed the students' learning behaviours using sequential behavioural analysis to discuss the learning process. Results showed that the CT ability of the EG was better than that of the CG, although no significant difference was found between the two groups' AI concepts and anxiety. The behaviour analysis also revealed that the EG students were willing to ask more questions, and conducted their VA evaluation, whereas the CG students were inclined to focus on the input and output of knowledge, and replicated what the teacher presented. Suggestions and implications are given for future research. • Helping students' voice assistant app creation using the experiential learning approach. • Contributing to developing students' CT and AI learning. • Analyzing students' learning behaviour patterns.

However, educators, especially K-12 teachers and researchers, have not clearly identified how to teach it. In this study, a meta-review of the studies published in academic journals from 2006 to 2017 was conducted to analyze application courses, adopted learning strategies, participants, teaching tools, programming languages, and course categories of CT education. From the review results, it was found that the promotion of CT in education has made great progress in the last decade. In addition to the increasing number of CT studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that CT has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. Meanwhile, most of the studies adopted Project-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Game-based Learning in the CT activities. In other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. Most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. In addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the CT ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly. Moreover, most studies reported the learners' CT performance and perspectives, while their information society ability was seldom trained. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of CT are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors, and policy makers.

10.1111/bjet.13266,"The proliferation of screen‐free programmable robotics allows teachers to implement age‐appropriate integrated activities that can promote child learning and development. However, very scarce is known about the challenges of using programmable robots as a tool to empower children in minority communities. This mixed‐methods case study examined a Free Quality Kindergarten situated in a low‐income public housing estate in Hong Kong to explore the affordances and challenges of robot programming (RP) in early childhood education (ECE). Both quantitative and qualitative data were generated through videotaped observations, child assessments and teacher interviews to journey with the teaching team as they managed to implement the newly introduced RP curriculum. Child assessment evidence revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in CT scores over 6 weeks of RP activities, while the pretest–posttest change of child self‐regulation scores was nonsignificant. Video analysis results further revealed that children's interaction level with the robot kit significantly predicted the change of self‐regulation over time. Qualitative results are presented to explicate the micro, meso and macro conditions that constrain the implementation of RP curriculum, including the following: (a) teachers' limited TPACK in RP education, (b) a disconnect between the RP curriculum and the school‐based curriculum, (c) limited resources and (d) the Confucian tradition and cultural barriers. These illustrate the intricacies involved in the implementation of RP education to empower marginalized children in under‐resourced ECE settings. This study will help bring systemic change to the ECE field by uncovering ecological difficulties in integrating new technologies to promote inclusiveness and sustainability for the future. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Screen‐free robot programming (RP) is beneficial for preschool children in terms of promoting their computational thinking (CT) and executive functioning.RP can be generally engaging for preschool children from a middle‐class background.What this paper adds The study is addressing the inclusiveness and sustainability according to the learning needs of kindergarten students, especially those from less privileged backgrounds.The story‐based approach to RP can cater to the learning needs and interests of children from a lower socio‐economic background, which is likely to enhance their CT skills.Children with a higher level of interaction with the robot kit benefited more from the RP activities in terms of self‐regulation skills.This study used multiple methods (ie, video analysis, teacher interview and child assessment) to reveal the effects of micro, meso and macro contexts on RP education in an under‐resourced Hong Kong kindergarten.Implications for practice and/or policy RP education should be cautiously prompted in diverse early childhood settings, especially the less privileged institutions, to enhance positive effects.Critical constraints on the use of programmable robots to empower marginalized children should be adequately addressed when trying to integrate RP into early childhood education.Teachers should receive training and continual support in RP‐related pedagogical strategies to facilitate and scaffold children's learning.

10.3390/math10203857,"Modernization and the ever-increasing trend of introducing modern technologies into various areas of everyday life require school graduates with programming skills. The ability to program is closely related to computational thinking, which is based on algorithmic thinking. It is well known that algorithmic thinking is the ability of students to work with algorithms understood as a systematic description of problem-solving strategies. Algorithms can be considered as a fundamental phenomenon that forms a point of contact between mathematics and informatics. As part of an algorithmic graph theory seminar, we conducted an experiment where we solved the knight's tour problem using the backtracking method to observe the change in students' motivation to learn algorithms at a higher cognitive level. Seventy-four students participated in the experiment. Statistical analysis of the results of the experiment confirmed that the use of the algorithm with decision-making in teaching motivated students to learn algorithms with understanding.

,"Integrated learning is fundamental in the current era of STEM education. However, articulating evidence of learning in such complex learning environments can be a challenge. This is especially true in elementary grades where developmentally-appropriate practices are not fully defined and understood yet. One of the newest additions to the integrated STEM discussion is computational thinking (i.e., STEM+C). The purpose of this research is to explore computational thinking practices in one Kindergarten classroom during the implementation of an integrated unit. Student artifacts were collected, deidentified, and analyzed for understanding of computational thinking. Using artifact analysis, student worksheets and prototypes designed were examined for evidence of computational thinking competencies prompted by the STEM+C lesson units. This paper provides evidence of how kindergarten students engage with computational thinking through analysis of student work. Students successfully convert an existing color pattern into letters but have difficulty writing a complete pattern with repeatable units. Students also reveal difficulty with pattern abstraction as evident from prototypes designs that mismatched with their selected patterns design.

,"For the past two decades, researchers and educators have been interested in integrating engineering into K-12 learning experiences. More recently, computational thinking (CT) has gained increased attention in K-12 engineering education. Computational thinking is broader than programming and coding. Some describe computational thinking as crucial to engineering problem solving and critical to engineering habits of mind like systems thinking. However, few studies have explored how computational thinking is exhibited by children, and CT competencies for children have not been consistently defined. Hence developing and implementing effective CT-related activities for children can be difficult. Therefore, exploring what computational thinking looks like for children is critical. Children can engage in, and learn to engage in computational thinking in both formal and informal settings. In this study, we are interested in exploring what computational thinking might look like in settings that approximate children's everyday experiences. More specifically, in order to investigate what computational thinking looks like when enacted by young children, we are interested in observing children and their family members engaging in open-ended engineering activities that are play-based. To accomplish this, we observed and video-recorded 5-8 year-old children and their families creating different structures together using large foam blocks that are out for free play at a science center. Based on our observations and analysis of the video-recordings, in this paper we report on the computational thinking practices and competencies children and families demonstrated while engaged in engineering play. Our findings can provide information needed to create a framework for promoting computational thinking in young children in informal settings.

,"This research study identifies the relationship between students' prior experiences with programming and their development of computational thinking and programming during their first year engineering experience. Many first year programs teach students basic programming concepts using languages like MATLAB or LABView. These languages are used because many of the disciplinary schools expect students to use computational models to analyze systems of interest. Some undergraduate engineering students are entering college with strong computational backgrounds, while others have no experience at all. This study is the first in a series to better identify students' transition into developing and reasoning with analytical tools. The learning progression across two programming languages is critical to developing a student's ability to generalize across various computational tools. The goal of this study is to identify how students progress in their ability to engage in computational thinking and programming relative to other learning outcomes for the course. This initial investigation uses students' prior background in programming and their exam scores to evaluate their interdependence of prior knowledge on learning programming across their first semester in university. As anticipated, learning a new language is difficult compared to the other course objectives. However, students with some prior knowledge of programming demonstrate a balanced performance between computational thinking and the other course objectives. Students who have limited programming experience do demonstrate a higher variance in their performance in problems related to computational thinking compared to their other course objectives. One of the leading factors is the time spent practicing programming. This paper will be of interest to instructors with the objective of developing computational thinking and programming in classrooms with a large variance in students' backgrounds with programming.

10.1007/s10956-015-9581-5,"Science and mathematics are becoming computational endeavors. This fact is reflected in the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and the decision to include 'computational thinking' as a core scientific practice. With this addition, and the increased presence of computation in mathematics and scientific contexts, a new urgency has come to the challenge of defining computational thinking and providing a theoretical grounding for what form it should take in school science and mathematics classrooms. This paper presents a response to this challenge by proposing a definition of computational thinking for mathematics and science in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices. In formulating this taxonomy, we draw on the existing computational thinking literature, interviews with mathematicians and scientists, and exemplary computational thinking instructional materials. This work was undertaken as part of a larger effort to infuse computational thinking into high school science and mathematics curricular materials. In this paper, we argue for the approach of embedding computational thinking in mathematics and science contexts, present the taxonomy, and discuss how we envision the taxonomy being used to bring current educational efforts in line with the increasingly computational nature of modern science and mathematics.

10.5585/40.2022.21736,"This article presents a didactic sequence carried out during a project on programming developed with a multigrade class of the first cycle of elementary school. In it, a Google Doodle and Scratch software were used to work on the idea of algorithm and repetition block, as well as to discuss the importance of a step-by-step instruction and order. The analysis is based on Jean Piaget's (1983) studies on the stages of development, schemas and awareness. It was possible to observe that the children established a relationship between the repetition block of the two resources, both similarity and differentiation, adapting the scheme used. Also, the activities about computational thinking made it possible for the group to reflect on what steps should be taken to reach the goal, an important logical chain for problem solving. Both Doodle and Scratch proved to be important tools for working on computational thinking.

Despite this overlap, the links between these two desirable educational outcomes are rarely made explicit, either in classrooms or in the literature. This paper presents Lattice Land, a computational learning environment and accompanying curriculum designed to support the development of mathematical habits of mind and promote computational thinking practices in high-school mathematics classrooms. Lattice Land is a mathematical microworld where learners explore geometrical concepts by manipulating polygons drawn with discrete points on a plane. Using data from an implementation in a low-income, urban public high school, we show how the design of Lattice Land provides an opportunity for learners to use computational thinking practices and develop mathematical habits of mind, including tinkering, experimentation, pattern recognition, and formalizing hypothesis in conventional mathematical notation. We present Lattice Land as a restructuration of geometry, showing how this new and novel representational approach facilitates learners in developing computational thinking and mathematical habits of mind. The paper concludes with a discussion of the interplay between computational thinking and mathematical habits of mind, and how the thoughtful design of computational learning environments can support meaningful learning at the intersection of these disciplines.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104562,"Although instruments for assessing students' computational thinking (CT) concepts in primary education have been developed, they have rarely been validated in terms of item response theory (IRT). We consider IRT to be a rigorous validation tool and apply it to a CT concepts test for primary education involving 13,670 students. A two-parameter logistic model was chosen over other IRT models, as it indicated an acceptable model fit and item fit. The discrimination parameters indicated that the instrument could effectively distinguish between students with various ability levels. Nominal response modelling in IRT was used to retrieve information from the students' responses, and those with a lower ability level were found to only consider one of the conditions provided, had no understanding of the repetition structure, and might have difficulties in associating a sprite with its corresponding codes. Based on ability estimates, we also found that the students' ability in terms of CT concepts increased with grades and that boys generally performed slightly better than girls. These results suggest that the instrument can be used to examine the learning achievements of students in terms of CT concepts. • We designed the test according to the focal knowledge, skills, and abilities (FKSAs) associated with the concepts. • We validated the CT concepts test using item response theory involving 13,670 primary school students. • This study contributes to the existing literature by validating a CT concepts test with methodological rigor. • We identified students' shortcomings based on their responses in understanding CT. • We found that students' CT concepts increased with grades, and boys performed slightly better than girls.

10.35674/kent.1445095,"Technological developments have enabled the acceleration of a shift from Computer Aided Design to Computational Design. The productive structure of Computational Design plays an important role in revealing the mechanisms that make up traditional design thinking. The traditional design thinking approach lacks an explicit structure for understanding and formulating the design process, the mechanisms involved, and the formation of design knowledge and representation. As a result, it is difficult to develop productive and evaluative knowledge. In contrast, the computational design approach facilitates the discovery of tacit knowledge, leading to the creation of productive and evaluative knowledge. The aim of this study is to create a learning framework for using the productive and evaluative knowledge discovered through the computational design approach in urban design. The study will discuss how to handle Cellular Automata, one of the most frequently used generative systems that reflects computational design thinking, in the context of urban design. This section will analyze the contributions of the generative method in the context of urban design, after discussing the computational thinking and approach methods used in Cellular Automata studies. Cellular Automata approaches are useful in urban development scenarios as they allow for the recognition of relationships and patterns between parts, and rediscovery of them during and after the generative process.

Schools are the first link to train competent students for today's society. However, the pandemic has conditioned the teaching–learning methodologies based on promoting STEAM in educational centers, which is the reason that leads us to carry out this study. The main objective of the research is to evaluate the STEAM dimensions in the sixth grade of primary education in times of pandemic. The study method is based on a quasi-experimental, descriptive and correlational design with an experimental group and a control group. The data are collected through a validated questionnaire, pre-test and post-test, which develops an assessment of student collaboration in STEAM activities. The sample is made up of 142 Spanish students, of which 68 belong to the control group and 74 to the experimental group. The conclusions of the study highlight that the active methodologies, based on computational thinking and on makerspaces of the future classroom, influenced the STEAM dimensions of the experimental group before the pandemic. However, the pandemic and the health restrictions in face-to-face classes led to a negative assessment of the experimental group in the STEAM dimensions.

The study employs an appropriate CT model for operationalising and exploring students’ CT skills development in two different age groups (15 and 18 years old) and across gender. 164 students of different education levels (Junior high: 89; High vocational: 75) engaged in ER learning activities (2 hours per week, 11 weeks totally) and their CT skills were evaluated at different phases during the activity, using different modality (written and oral) assessment tools. The results suggest that: (a) students reach eventually the same level of CT skills development independent of their age and gender, (b) CT skills in most cases need time to fully develop (students’ scores improve significantly towards the end of the activity), (c) age and gender relevant differences appear when analysing students’ score in the various specific dimensions of the CT skills model, (d) the modality of the skill assessment instrument may have an impact on students’ performance, (e) girls appear in many situations to need more training time to reach the same skill level compared to boys.

To understand how to effectively teach complex systems and computational content to younger students, we conducted a study in four urban middle school classrooms comparing 2-week-long curricular units-one using a physical robotics participatory simulation and one using a virtual robotics participatory simulation. We compare the two units for their effectiveness in supporting students' complex systems thinking and computational thinking skills. We find that while both units improved student outcomes to roughly the same extent, they engendered different perspectives on the content. That is, students using the physical system were more likely to interpret situations from a bottom-up ('agent') perspective, and students using the virtual system were more likely to employ a top-down ('aggregate') perspective. Our outcomes suggest that the medium of students' interactions with systems leads to differences in their learning from and about those systems. We explore the reasons for and effects of these differences, challenges in teaching this content, and student learning gains. The paper contributes operationalizable definitions of complex systems perspectives and computational perspectives and provides both a theoretical framework for and empirical evidence of a relationship between those two perspectives.

Also, there is a need for professional development opportunities for CS educators. This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students' computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students' CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students' CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills.

10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.012,"Programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.

10.1080/08993408.2018.1533297,"Unplugged activities have been one approach to introduce computational thinking (CT) to students before any form of coding is involved. This paper reports on a study that examines the evaluation of the types of CT skills inculcated through an unplugged activity. Students in a grade 9 class were engaged in an unplugged activity on sorting before being asked to represent their understanding in the form of pseudo-English, flowchart or Python code. The assessment of CT skills comprises the aspects of decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, abstraction and evaluation. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was used to take a closer look at the unplugged CT activity and the subsequent artifact production. Such a QCA analysis can be used to inform a framework for designing instruction and tasks to target and teach certain types of CT knowledge in novice programmers, as well as for assessing an instruction package as to what CT knowledge is being covered.

10.1007/s10798-022-09788-5,"Over the past several years, creativity has been recognized as an important skill for success in STEM education, engineering design and computational thinking. There is limited research on how to apply Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO) engineering design in STEM courses and how it affects students' creativity. This study strategically integrated computational thinking (CT), STEM, and CDIO engineering design, based on Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory, into a course. This study has adopted a framework to design creative learning materials and examined how this framework impacts students' creativity. This study used a pretest–posttest nonequivalent-groups design. The study investigated a STEM course which had 40 participants (n = 40, male = 11, female = 29) for 12 weeks. 6 weeks were spent using traditional teaching and 6 weeks integrating a CDIO framework into computational thinking. All the students in the course were college students with teacher college backgrounds. To examine the impact of our course, we used a questionnaire to examine the students' creativity before and after the STEM course was applied. Our results show that our course had a significantly impact on our students' creativity, particularly in the case of the male students. This finding is consistent with the findings of other research studies. This study also offers some suggestions for teachers who wish to improve their learning materials.

This course has been implemented over the past decades by a team led by Academician of the RAS A.L. Semenov. In the problems, it is necessary to find, build, or list all objects that satisfy a certain system of conditions. The student conducts these activities in a visual world of basic objects of discrete mathematics and computer science: strings (finite sequences of symbols), bags (multisets), tables, trees, and statements containing quantifiers. The connections of these problems with problems in computational combinatorics (counting the number of options), with search problems in the theory of computational complexity, with ""big ideas,"" and general cognitive strategies for their formation in education are considered.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104721,"The use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown to be effective in fostering students' computational thinking (CT) skills. However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto-scoring feedback to promote students' deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first-year university students who used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students' internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming education are discussed. • AR Bot is a virtual educational robotics with 3D visuals and delayed feedback. • Use of AR Bot promoted students' learning enjoyment compared to Scratch. • AR Bot-induced enjoyment led to higher computational skill dimensions. • AR Bot enhanced students' algorithm design and algorithm efficiency skills. • AR Bot-driven computational skills enhanced students' academic achievement.

10.1007/s11528-022-00727-8,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an essential literacy skill for all children to develop, yet conceptual, practical, and empirical work with preschool-age children is scarce. A particular gap in the research is how CT instruction should be enacted (e.g., free play, guided play, levels of scaffolding, degree of child-initiated activities, and structure of programming tasks). Therefore, we aimed to describe what preschool children's CT experiences are like when button-operated robots are introduced into their guided play. This interpretive phenomenological study applied the Mosaic Approach to explore the emergence of CT skills during guided play with a button-operated robot (Bee-Bot). Participants were 29 preschool-age children from an early childhood education center in the northeastern United States. Data sources included audio-visual recordings, observations, child focus groups, and child-generated artifacts. The findings suggest children constructed meaning across the CT dimensions, connected with others through dialogue and negotiation, and used guidance from adults to extend their learning.

However, the use of ChatGPT in academic research has sparked debate and raised concerns about its influence on research and publishing. By offering an actual scenario and suggestions, this study intends to shed light on the practical implementation of ChatGPT in academic research. The dataset for this study includes 3,860 students from Thailand's basic and secondary school levels. The survey data gathered focuses on investigating innovative thinking skills. The findings suggest that ChatGPT might be a useful technique for generating first ideas in academic studies. However, it is crucial for researchers to exercise caution as they may encounter certain challenges during the process. As a result, while using ChatGPT in academic research, researchers must be aware of these issues and make educated judgments appropriately. Given the possible uses and ramifications of ChatGPT, the academic community must develop detailed protocols governing its usage in research and subsequent publishing. These rules will ensure the proper and ethical use of ChatGPT in the academic setting.

This design-based research study presents a geography course offered during the 2019/20 winter semester in computer modeling, with no prior coding knowledge. It was implemented in two elective classes: one in the Bachelor of Science program and one in the teacher program. Interviews were conducted to monitor the students' development, and the final reports showed their competencies at the end of the course. Since there were no noticeable differences between the Bachelor of Science students and the teacher trainees in terms of competence acquisition, four learning types could be described based on analysis of the interviews and final reports, which are important for the planning and adaptation of the course concepts. In summary, our results show four key findings: (1) mere reproduction of learning content is of no value for the development of geographic modeling skills; (2) the ability to access conceptual thinking patterns is crucial; (3) process-level understanding is a fundamental prerequisite for advanced geographic modeling understanding; and (4) poor programming skills hinder but do not prevent at least basic modeling understanding.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104445,"Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students' CT. • Computational thinking (CT) skills are important for students in the digital world. • Construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) can improve students' CT skills. • Construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM) can improve students' CT skills. • COS-MM could better improve students' CT skills than those with CBS-MM.

However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success. • PBL-CT implementations are still considered limited in research with 3 frameworks, 2 models, 7 tools and (6) techniques. • A taxonomy of the PBL-CT literature is proposed. • The largest study was conducted for primary schools, dominated by the USA. • The articles were mainly involved with computing, followed by STEM, with few being dedicated to non-STEM fields. • The use of PBL-CT in education yielded positive findings, ranging from to skill to attitude.

In this study, a scale has been developed for the purpose of determining the levels of computational thinking skills (CTS) of the students. CTS is a five-point likert type scale and consists of 29 items that could be collected under five factors. The study group of this work consists of 726 students educated at the levels of associate degree and undergraduate degree with formal education in Amasya University for the first application. For the second application 580 students who were educated in pedagogical formation education via distance education in Amasya University. The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item distinctiveness analyses, internal consistency coefficients and constancy analyses. As a result of the conducted analyses, it has been concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could measure the computational thinking skills of the students. In addition; the digital age individuals are expected to have the computational thinking skill, and at what degree they have these skills, the revelation of whether the levels they have are sufficient or not are a requirement. Within this frame, it could be said that the scale could make significant contributions to the literature.

In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology. • A board game with an online and offline version was co-designed with children. • A gamified robotic agent was used to encourage problem-solving during coding activities. • Increased motivation was observed in the offline version of the game when it came to coding and moving the robotic agent. • Equal levels of engagement and perception of game mechanics were observedin both versions of the game.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104457,"Programming attitude has received increasing attention in programming and computational thinking (CT) education. However, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students' programming attitudes and their CT skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. This study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (χ2/df = 2.308, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (12–13 years old). It then analyzed the relationship between students' programming attitudes and CT skills considering gender differences. Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted their CT skills. Girls have higher CT skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. Third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and CT skills was discussed among the sample (N = 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and CT skills. Two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students' programming attitudes and CT skills. For programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. For CT, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest CT level. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve between students' programming learning duration and CT skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career. Implications for promoting junior high school students' CT skills and their positive attitudes toward programming are also discussed. • The programming attitudes scale has sufficient reliability and validity. • Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted CT skills. • There are significant gender differences in CT skills and programming attitudes. • Programming attitudes play an intermediary role between programming experience and CT. • The two specific factors of programming experience had different effects on CT and programming attitudes.

10.1111/bjet.13084,"This paper reports on the first iteration of the Computational Thinking Summer Institute, a month‐long programme in which high school teachers co‐designed computationally enhanced mathematics and science curricula with researchers. The co‐design process itself was a constructionist learning experience for teachers resulting in constructionist curricula to be used in their own classrooms. We present three case studies to illustrate different ways teachers and researchers divided the labour of co‐design and the implications of these different co‐design styles for teacher learning and classroom enactment. Specifically, some teachers programmed their own computational tools, while others helped to conceptualise them but left the construction to their co‐design partners. Results indicate that constructionist co‐design is a promising dual approach to curriculum and professional development but that sometimes these two goals are in tension. Most teachers gained considerable confidence and skills in computational thinking, but sometimes the pressure to finish curriculum development during the institute led teachers to leave construction of computational tools to their co‐design partners, limiting their own opportunities for computational learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic? Computational tools can support constructionist science and math learning by making powerful ideas tangible.Supporting teachers to learn computational thinking and to use constructionist pedagogies is challenging.What this paper adds? Constructionist co‐design is a promising approach to simultaneously support curriculum development and professional development, but there are tensions to navigate in trying to accomplish both goals simultaneously.Implications for practice and/or policy Designers of professional development should consider constructionist co‐design as an approach but should be aware of potential tensions and prepare for them.

10.1007/s10798-019-09559-9,"This study investigates the development of algorithmic thinking as a part of computational thinking skills and self-efficacy of primary school pupils using programmable robots in different instruction variants. Computational thinking is defined in the context of twenty-first century skills and describes processes involved in (re)formulating a problem in a way that a computer can process it. Programming robots offers specific affordances as it can be used to develop programs following a Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) cycle. The literature provides evidence that programming robots has the potential to enhance algorithmic thinking as a component of computational thinking. Specifically there are indications that pupils who use SRA-programming learn algorithmic skills better and achieve a higher level of self-efficacy in an open, scaffold learning environment than through direct instruction. In order to determine the influence of the instruction variant used, an experimental research design was made in which pupils solved algorithm-based mathematical problems (grid diagrams) in a preliminary measurement and their self-efficacy determined via a questionnaire. As an intervention, pupils learn to solve programming issues in pairs using ""Lego NXT"" robots and ""Mindstorms"" software in two instruction variants. The post-measurement consists of a Lego challenge, solving mathematical problems (grid diagrams), and a repeated self-efficacy questionnaire. This research shows an increase of our measures on algorithmic thinking dependent on the amount of SRA usage (though not significant). Programming using the SRA-cycle can be considered as the cause of the measured effect. The instruction variant used during the robotic intervention seems to play only a marginal role.

10.1007/s11423-021-10061-0,"In most middle schools, learning is segregated by discipline. Yet interdisciplinary approaches have been shown to cultivate creative thinking, support problem solving, and develop interest while supporting knowledge gains (NAE & NRC in STEM Integration in K-12 Education: Status, Prospects, and an Agenda for Research. National Academies Press, Washington, 2014). The Designing Biomimetic Robots project emphasizes problem-based learning to integrate engineering, science, and computational thinking (CT). During a 3 to 4-week unit, students study the natural world to learn how animals accomplish different tasks, then design a robot inspired by what they learned. The project engages students in science, engineering, and CT practices. Over the course of a 3-year project, we used a design-based research approach to: (1) identify and describe strategies and challenges that emerge from integrated curriculum design, (2) explicate how a balance of integrated disciplines can provide opportunities for student participation in science, engineering, and CT practices, and (3) explore how a technology design task can support students' participation in integrated learning. Data from three focal groups (one from each year of the project) suggest that a focused design task, supported by explicit and targeted supports for science, CT, and engineering practices, led to a student technology design process that was driven by disciplinary understanding. This work highlights the importance of drawing out and prioritizing alignments between disciplines (Barber in Educ Des, 2(8), 2015), to enable integrated learning. Additionally, this work demonstrates how a technology design task can support student learning across disciplines, and how engaging in CT practices can further help students draw these connections.

10.1016/j.jpdc.2016.12.027,"Nowadays, many fields of science and engineering are evolving through the joint contribution of complementary fields. Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master’s degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master’s degree are shown. This overall approach has been refined through the Master’s life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104379,"Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers. • myCTGWBL has positive effects on teachers' computational thinking teaching and learning repertoire. • 369 teachers participated in the empirical testing. • The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) explains the success factors of myCTGWBL. • Teachers claimed that continuous professional development would benefit the teaching and learning practices.

However, little is known about how the action of adding favorite projects on Scratch social media influences programming skill improvement. On Scratch social media, learners select personally intriguing projects to view and learn from. Favorite projects both motivate users to participate on social media and serve as scaffolding material for learners. In this study, we analyzed a dataset of 50,786 users from 5 years of longitudinal activities on Scratch social media using the Zones of Proximal Flow theory. To understand how favorite projects influence learners, we compared the frequency of social media use and programming skill improvement between users who did and did not add favorite projects, and we found a significant difference in programming skill improvement. Among users with favorite projects, there is a proximal difference of two to five Dr. Scratch scores of the favorite project above users' capability level, which maximizes the frequency of social media use and programming skill improvement.

10.1016/j.ecresq.2023.05.002,"• Evidence-based early childhood computer science curriculum utilizing the free ScratchJr programming, Coding as Another Language (CAL). • Results from cluster randomized controlled trial show CAL's feasibility to implement, and effectiveness for improving coding skills. • Despite the time taken away from the math and literacy blocks to teach CAL, standardized test for literacy improved and math remained the same. • During the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on computational thinking. This paper describes the iterative research and evaluation of the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum that utilizes the free ScratchJr programming language in kindergarten to second grade. CAL was designed using principles of three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism, which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development, which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students' learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking.

The idea of the application is that it can simplify the application of these activities in the classroom. However, it can also allow individual users to accomplish these activities by receiving automatic feedback. Online questionnaires were sent to students and to computer science teachers who already had experience with unplugged computing. We have also performed a spontaneous observation. Its purpose was to identify some aspects such as interest and collaboration of the students of three classes of the first year of high school submitted to the use of the application in the classroom. There was also a semistructured interview with the teacher. The results presented give evidence that the application may be suitable for individual or classroom use. We have observed that its use in the classroom may lead to more interaction between the students and to collaborative learning. Besides, it seems to be an easier way to apply activities that stimulate computational thinking.

Given this need, this research had the following objectives: i) design didactic materials on Unplugged Computer Science for the teaching of Computing in Basic Education (4th and 5th grade of Elementary Education), ii) to train teachers to understand basic concepts of Computational Thinking and use the developed material in Basic Education schools (public education); and iii) evaluate the developed material with the teachers of elementary school. The research involved the design and evaluation of didactic material and promoted continuous teacher training. The data collected from the teachers were categorized and coded to identify the acceptance of the Unplugged Computer Science didactic material. The main results show the didactic material as ""Adequate"" and ""Well accepted"" by teachers, and between the created topics, the most used was ""Algorithms"" and ""Pattern Recognition"". At the end of the continuing education meetings, it was also identified that 46% of the teachers demonstrated that they had successfully assimilated the studied concepts. Therefore, this research demonstrates that the didactic material had a high degree of acceptance on the part of the teachers, caused a positive impact on the students, and also evidences the need for further studies proposing and evaluating new didactic materials.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104353,"Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both. • We present a scoping review of studies of CT and creativity. • There are geographical, age, and subject gaps in these studies. • CT is mostly defined in a broader manner than programming or computer science. • Creativity is mostly referred to as product- or person-related, CT is barely measured by product.

,"Parallel computing is generally perceived to be difficult topic to understand and learn. This paper presents a design case study that was conceptualized and implemented to introduce non-computational savvy audience (e.g. students, K-12, senators, elderly, etc.) to the concepts of parallel computational thinking. In order to visualize and better comprehend the data transmission mechanism and algorithmic patterns of parallel computing, a kinetic computing sculpture comprising of a functional cluster of Raspberry Pi computers has been built by an interdisciplinary group of researchers. To evaluate users' learning experience, a focus group interview with high school students was conducted. Data from the study reveal that students found the sculpture an engaging and effective visual artifact that illustrated parallel computing patterns. After interacting with the sculpture, the participants were able to explain parallel computing to other participants and correctly answer all assessment related questions.

10.1016/j.chb.2021.106836,"Computational thinking (CT) practices have gained increasing importance in primary school education. However, there are few tools to measure primary school students' CT practices that are based on rigorous psychometric approaches. This study developed an operational definition for CT practices by exploring the key dimensions of their composition and, more importantly, developed and validated a generic test tool that can effectively assess students' CT practices. Items to measure CT practices were developed using the evidence-centered design (ECD) approach. These items prompted students to exhibit behaviors that demonstrated their skills in the four dimensions of CT practice, namely testing and debugging, algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. A test consisting of these items was administered to 13,956 Grade 4–6 primary school students from 56 public schools in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed based on the item response theory (IRT) approach, together with other psychometric tests. A bi-factor three-parameter logistic model was ultimately adopted for test validation, as it fitted the data better than the corresponding two-parameter and one-parameter logistic models. The results validated the four-dimensional structure of the CT practices test. The reliability, test item characteristics, and CT practice abilities of students are also discussed. • Provided a theory-driven base for the test development of computational thinking practices. • Developed test tool of computational thinking practices based on the evidence-centered design approach. • Testlet response analysis was adopted for test validation and refinement. • The computational thinking practices test was generic for potential use in a broad range of CT contexts.

10.1080/10494820.2020.1711326,"There is considerable debate and ambiguity around what constitutes ""computational thinking"" (CT). In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct field of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other fields. Many recent efforts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these efforts may help identify specific curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not sufficiently capture the specificity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led efforts. In this special issue, we offer a counterproposal to one-size-fits-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent definitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning. Reflecting on these examples can help researchers and educators alike cultivate an awareness of the ways in which learners and educators leverage computing to think, create, and participate across a variety of spaces.

The advent of interactive ebooks, online sites (e.g. CodeAcademy), youth directed tools (e.g. Scratch, Tynker) and the vast library of open source code, have dramatically changed the landscape of computer programming pedagogy. These tools each purport to address different audiences as well as varying skill sets of student programmers, such as coding literacy and computational thinking, key abilities of successful programmers. However, developing computational thinking, which is similar to generic problem-solving, remains difficult and elusive in many educational programs and online pedagogical tools.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104222,"This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The ""Coding as Another Language"" (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated ""unplugged"" CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (M change = 0.94, p <.001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (M change = 0.27, p =.07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p <.01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum. This provides evidence that a developmentally appropriate curriculum for teaching young children to code can accelerate their acquisition of CT skills. • We examined the impact of the CAL-KIBO coding curriculum on children's computational thinking (CT). • An unplugged CT assessment (TechCheck) was used to compare coders to non-coding controls. • CT improved significantly in coders ages 5–9 compared to age-matched controls. • CT improvements after 7 weeks of coding equated to 6 months of normal development. • Algorithms, modularity, and representation probes showed improvements in children who coded.

Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers' changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction. • Learn sequence, algorithms, and logic more readily than variables, conditional logic, and functions. • Report lower confidence with decomposition and abstraction than other computational thinking practices. • are less confident in their ability to foster computational perspectives; and. • Develop greater confidence to teach coding through hands-on activities and in-class implementation.

10.1016/j.chb.2021.106746,"Educational research on predicting learners' computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners' computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners' computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners' computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners' coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners' computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed. • The averaged indicators in learners' codes did not reveal significant associations with learner performance. • Coding behaviors categorized into groups by a computational technique showed different levels of self-regulated learning. • Time-spent patterns on coding were related to learners' computational thinking skills. • The patterns of successful coding task completion were related to learners' final grades.

10.1016/j.chb.2021.106707,"There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning. • Described an emergent approach to the development of game-based learning assessments. • Used data-mining methods to create detectors of students' implicit computational thinking based on gameplay behaviors. • Results showed in-game measures were significantly related to external measures of computational thinking. • Applications of in-game measures as formative computational thinking assessments of teachers and designers.

This study employed the use of a self-built AI platform (Ladder) for students to systematically learn and apply AI learning model established by the partial least squares (PLS) method to investigate the influence between variables (learning attitudes, self-regulated learning, AI anxiety, individual impact, computational thinking abilities, cognitive styles). This study was particularly conducted in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering of a top national university in Southern Taiwan. The valid data were collected from 65 students (55 male students; 10 female students). Furthermore, this study demonstrated the relationship between cognitive style, self-regulated learning and computational thinking. For the first time, it explored the impact of AI anxiety and completed existing research on it. The results of this study show that interest in learning positively affects learning attitudes. In addition, learning attitudes have a positive influence on each individual's performance. Based on multiple theories and the artificial intelligence learning platform, the model proposed in this study effectively understood students' learning status.

10.1111/bjet.13086,"In this personal essay, I explain how my use of visual modelling has the capacity to broaden constructionism in five important ways. (1) It introduces new techniques for students to describe and document, in a personal way, what they are actually doing in modelling. (2) It introduces the big ideas of mathematical modelling and computational thinking in a way that is far more inclusive than many other constructionist‐oriented courses that are labelled as math, science or computer science. (3) It favours the modelling of student‐selected objects in the physical world over the modelling of concepts and problems drawn more directly from traditional math and science. (4) It introduces the core ideas of design and colour theories in context. (5) It demonstrates the benefits of using narratives and personal journaling to explore the thought processes that help us make sense of the world. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic We know a great deal about the successes of STEM‐centred constructionism.Constructionist‐inspired Scratch, FabLabs and Maker Fairs attract millions in and out of schools all over the world.The worldwide teaching of coding, beginning in the earliest years, is now informed by constructionist ideas. UCL ScratchMaths is a good example of this.What this paper adds It expands constructionist teaching and research beyond math and computer science, into the fine arts, social sciences, literature and the humanities.It describes a multidisciplinary teaching project, begun in 1981, that mixes mathematical modelling, computer programming, drawing, narrative psychology, art history, design theory, intellectual history, writing and theatre—within a constructivist/constructionist framework.It recommends that the history of successful interdisciplinary courses, like the one described in this paper, should be better known and documented so that lessons can be shared.Implications for practice and/or policy For constructionism to become a theory of learning, constructionists must first explore learning in many different disciplines and contexts. Interdisciplinarity can provide a useful opening for doing so.For constructionists to play an important role in creating interdisciplinary courses, they must not just learn to work openly with colleagues from other disciplines, but they must also be eager to read and study approaches different from their own.Finally, interdisciplinary activity occurs most felicitously when the actors involved commit to respectful exchanges, attentive listening and a willingness to create a common enterprise.

10.1002/acp.3809,"Summary: Troubleshooting is a particular problem‐solving process comprising error detection, fault diagnosis, and system restoration. Since automation of systems has become increasingly complex and ubiquitous, troubleshooting skills are crucial to maintain safety and security in a variety of contexts. The planned study aims at examining troubleshooting strategies and how to induce them by means of simple visual aids and concise instructions. To this end, a computerized task consisting of network troubleshooting problems will be employed in an experimental study with repeated measures. Indicators of strategy use and performance will be tested for their relation to availability and differential use of visual aids, to cognitive styles that affect how individuals deal with challenges or system information, and to cognitive processes that are involved in metacognition and executive function. The planned research is expected to help gain insights into the cognitive determinants of troubleshooting, reverse engineering, and their links to computational thinking.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104431,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students' CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the CT. • Educational robotics (ER) tasks lack guidelines to foster computational thinking (CT). • We analysed the impact of delayed visual feedback and guidance on CT in an ER task. • The presence or absence of guidance has no significant impact on student learning. • Delayed feedback (DF) helps foster CT, in particular ""computational perspectives"". • DF's benefits seem to stem from students spending more time reflecting on the task.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104425,"There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages. • The cognitive development of computational thinking is differential across age. • Computational thinking builds on a convolute of several other cognitive abilities. • Computational thinking is associated with verbal reasoning abilities. • Computational thinking is associated with non-verbal visuospatial abilities. • Computational thinking is correlated to numerical abilities in primary school.

10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639,"Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.

Several studies focus on defining the so-called digital skills, also providing indications that higher cognitive skills are required. However, they do not examine how young individuals could perform better to adapt to the continuously evolving digital environment. To address this gap, the study introduces and analyses the construct of digital intelligence, representing the new way of thinking and behaviour in the digital environment. For the purposes of the study, a set of tests was given to students at Greek high schools, targeting 15–16 years old students and employing original tests to assess digital intelligence. According to the findings, digital intelligence is composed of: (1) logical reasoning, algorithms, and evaluation, (2) abstraction, decomposition, and patterns and generalisation, (3) digital emotional intelligence and communication, (4) digital safety and security, and (5) digital identity, use, literacy, and rights. Assessing digital intelligence, as proposed in this study, could be used to assist vocational guidance, employee selection and evaluation, and development of revised school curricula.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104083,"Computational Thinking (CT) through programming attracts increased attention as it is considered an ideal medium for the development of 21st century skills. This intense attention leads to K-12 initiatives around the world and a rapid increase in relevant research studies. However, studies show challenges in CT research and educational practice. In addition, the domain has not been mapped to facilitate comprehensive understanding of the domain challenges and development of CT curricula. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model based on a systematic literature review that maps the CT through programming in K-12 education domain. The proposed Computational Thinking through Programming in K-12 education (CTPK-12) conceptual model emerges from the synthesis of 101 studies and the identification of CT Areas. The proposed model consists of six CT Areas (namely Knowledge Base, Learning Strategies, Assessment, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building) and their relationships. The model could aid domain understanding and serve as a basis for future research studies. In addition, it could support the integration of CT into K-12 educational practices, providing evidence to educational stakeholders and researchers as well as bringing closer research, practice and policy. Image 1 • Studies are reviewed to develop a conceptual model for Computational Thinking (CT) through programming in K-12 education. • The proposed CTPK-12 model illustrates CT research Areas and their Relationships. • The model's CT Areas include Knowledge Base, Learning Strategies, Assessment, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. • The model reveals unexploited CT Areas, namely Factors and Capacity Building. • The model enables formulating unexplored research questions, such as which tools support which learning strategies.

10.1016/j.chb.2020.106587,"This paper reports on a research study of 45 classes in US schools (grades 3–8) using Zoombinis, a popular Computational Thinking (CT) learning game for ages 8 to adult. The study examined the relationship among student gameplay, related classroom activity, and the development of students' CT practices in Zoombinis classes. A combination of research methods, including educational data-mining on game data logs, cluster analysis on teacher logs of classroom activity, and multilevel modeling, was used to determine the impact of the duration and nature of student gameplay, as well as the extent and nature of classroom activity, on student CT practices. Automated detectors of gameplay CT practices built for this research were significant predictors of external post-assessment scores, and thus show promise as implicit assessments of CT practices within gameplay. Students with high duration of gameplay and high gameplay CT practices scored highest on external post-assessment of CT practices, when accounting for pre-assessment scores. This research suggests that Zoombinis is an effective CT learning tool and CT assessment tool for elementary- and middle-school students. • Automated data mining detectors detected students' Computational Thinking in Zoombinis. • Longer duration of gameplay related to more Computational Thinking exhibited outside the game. • More CT practices exhibited in gameplay related to more Computational Thinking exhibited outside the game. • Students' gender, grade level, or other CT activity were not related to more Computational Thinking outside the game.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104060,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key 21st-century skill. This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4% for CT level and 61.2% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. The findings contribute to a better understanding of CT as a construct and have implications for CT instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in CT learning. • A conceptual framework of predictors of the initial level and development of computational thinking. • Areas of predictors: student characteristics, home environment, learning opportunities. • Investigation over one school year in a naturalistic classroom setting using latent growth curve modeling. • Gender differences can be partially explained by female students' lower self-concept and self-determined motivation. • Deliberate effort may be necessary for effectively integrating computational thinking in computer science instruction.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104023,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming essential in all aspects of work and life, and CT has become part of the K-12 curriculum around the world. Yet, more research is needed to better understand how to help elementary school students acquire CT skills effectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled ""Computational Thinking with Scratch"" with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own. The results showed that the students in the EG improved their CT skills and SE more significantly than those in the CG group. There was a low correlation between CT and SE in the post-test of both groups. The interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. The findings suggest that in K-12 programming teachers could use PPP as an effective approach to improve students' CT skills, programming SE, and beyond. • Partial Pair Programming (PPP) significantly improved CT skills of 4th grade students. • PPP significantly improved self-efficacy (SE) of the 4th grade students. • There is low correlation between CT and SE. • PPP significantly improved boys' CT skills in all pairs, girls in boy-girl pairs. • PPP significantly improved boys' programming SE, not girls' SE.

Personal and behavioral data have become valuable material for statistical and machine learning techniques that have the potential to profile, infer, and predict people's needs, values, and behavior. As a response, researchers are calling for data literacies and computational thinking to facilitate people's capacity and volition to make informed actions in their digital world. Yet, efforts and curricula towards a greater understanding of computational mechanisms of new media ecology are sorely missing from K12-education as well as from teacher education. This paper provides an overview of tensions that teachers and educators will face when they attempt to bridge participatory learning with a more robust understanding of machine learning and algorithmic production of social and cultural practices.

This meta-analysis examines whether greater computational thinking is linked to greater academic achievement among students from 1st graders in primary school to 4th year seniors at university. Results from 34 studies showed that computational thinking and academic achievement were positively correlated (0.288). Moderator analysis showed that this correlation was (a) stronger among students in Eastern cultures than Western cultures; (b) strongest among primary school students, less strong among secondary school students, and weakest among undergraduates; (c) stronger among females than males; and (d) strongest when assessing assignment scores; less strong with GPA, course grade, or tests; and weakest with quizzes. Neither subject content (e.g., math, science) nor sampling strategy (e.g., randomized, convenience) moderated the link between computational thinking and academic achievement. In sum, the positive link between computational thinking and academic achievement is moderated by culture, grade, achievement indicators, and gender.

Usually, these environments exploit the tangibility at the entrance, i.e., in the construction phase of the program, through Tangible Interfaces. In this paper, we seek to explore the tangibility of the TaPrEC, a tangible programming environment, by extending it to the execution phase, providing feedback in the physical world. We present the integration of TaPrEC with Sphero, a robotic ball that connects to other devices. To evaluate this new system, we conducted 6 workshops with teachers and children in a learning space.

The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers' orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise.

,"The teaching base of national engineering mathematics course has important practical significance and special function for the training of engineering talents. The construction of engineering mathematics base should be further strengthened. Based on the background of the development of new engineering and the requirements of the new economy for talent training, this paper points out that the construction of mathematics course teaching base should pay more attention to the innovation of construction idea, construction content and the reform of teaching mode, and strengthen the construction of teaching ability. Involving in the development of new engineering, grasping the new opportunities brought by the development of new engineering to the reform of mathematics education, innovating the construction concept and leading the base to a higher level and higher quality in the construction of new engineering is the primary task of the base construction. Focusing on improving teachers' ability to integrate mathematics, computational Thinking and disciplines, giving better play to the driving role of mathematics in the training of innovative talents, deepening the comprehensive reform of engineering mathematics teaching, improving the quality of personnel training, and providing high-quality personnel support for the development of new engineering are the central works of base construction.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103832,"The inclusion of computational thinking (CT) in the classroom is something that the present and future society is demanding. However, this domain remains largely unexplored, especially in the first years of Primary Education. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the inclusion of the so-called unplugged activities favours the development of CT in the students of the early years of Primary Education. To this end, a quasi-experimental study has been carried out to explore the eventual benefit of a mixed approach that combines both unplugged and plugged-in activities. In particular, 84 second-grade students took part in the experiment. Three questions were evaluated: the development of their CT skills, their motivation towards the proposed instruction, and the influence of students' gender in the two previous areas. The intervention was designed on a selection of activities extracted from Code. org courses, and was divided into two phases, one in which one group worked with unplugged activities and the other with plugged-in activities, and a second where both groups worked with plugged-in activities. Analysing the three proposed questions through tests performed before, in between and after the instruction, it is concluded that the inclusion of unplugged activities in the instruction seems beneficial taking into account CT, motivation and gender. • Unplugged activities improve computational thinking skills in early Primary Education. • A computational thinking instruction with unplugged activities enhances motivation. • Gender does not influence computational thinking skills acquisition. • Gender influences motivation towards a computational thinking instruction.

10.1016/j.chb.2019.106230,"This study aimed at investigating whether Computational Thinking (CT) Perspectives can foster Computational Identity (CI) among primary school students in programming learning from the perspective of situated learning theory. This study conceptualized CT perspectives as a multidimensional construct that comprises (1) ability to connect, (2) ability to question, and (3) ability to express, and CI with four subcomponents including (1) programming affiliation, (2) programming engagement, (3) programming actualization, and (4) programming goal setting. Students who received at least 6-month programming training for computational thinking development were invited to participate in this study. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) suggested that the CT perspectives instrument (n = 100) and CI instrument (n = 241) reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study. In the main study, survey answers (N = 215) including CT perspectives and CI were collected. Results of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed positive relationships between CT perspectives and CI formation among primary school students. Mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster CI formation through ability to express, while ability to connect can directly foster CI formation. Implications were discussed at the end of the study. • Learning visual programming contributes to positive learning outcomes. • CT perspectives facilitated by visual programming contribute to CI formation. • Young learners' willingness to connect with peers is positively related to CI formation. • Young learners' willingness to express with programming artifacts is positively related to CI formation. • Young learners' willingness to question is positively related to CI formation only if they are willing to express.

10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.018,"The study examined the effects of learning with the Bee-Bot on young boys' and girls' computational thinking within the context of two scaffolding techniques. The study reports statistically significant learning gains between the initial and final assessment of children's computational thinking skills. Also, according to the findings, while both boys and girls benefited from the scaffolding techniques, a statistically significant interaction effect was detected between gender and scaffolding strategy showing that boys benefited more from the individualistic, kinesthetic, spatially-oriented, and manipulative-based activity with the cards, while girls benefited more from the collaborative writing activity. In regards to the children's problem-solving strategies during debugging, the results showed that the majority of them used decomposition as a strategy to deal with the complexity of the task. These results are important, because they show that children at this very young age are able to cope with the complexity of a learning task by decomposing it into a number of subtasks that are easier for them to tackle. The research contributes to the body of knowledge about the teaching of computational thinking. In addition, the study has practical significance for curriculum developers, instructional leaders, and classroom teachers, as they can use the results of this study to design curricula and classroom activities with a focus on the broader set of computational thinking skills, and not only coding. • The study examined the effects of learning with the Bee-Bot on computational thinking. • A gender-friendly learning environment was designed. • An interaction effect was found between gender and scaffolding strategy. • Young children used decomposition as a problem-solving strategy during debugging.

Big research efforts are made to determine which pedagogical means should be used. One research trend is based on the idea that teaching programming since Primary Education suffices to improve CT. In our previous work, we proposed and validated a methodology based on metaphors and used of Scratch (MECOPROG) to teach basic programming concepts to children. It is our hypothesis H that by applying MECOPROG, students will develop their CT. To check H, we carried out an experiment with 132 Primary Education Students (9–12 years in age). At the beginning of the experiment, all students were asked to fill in a programming concepts test and two tests to measure their CT. During the sessions, all students were taught according to MECOPROG. Finally, they took the three tests again. A significant increase in the results on all the tests has been measured, supporting the use of metaphors and Scratch to teach computer programming concepts to Primary Education students to develop their CT. • Computational Thinking can be improved using metaphors and Scratch. • Primary Education students' Computational Thinking can be improved. • Primary Education students can learn basic programming concepts.

10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103613,"Although several investigations of spatial reasoning and mental rotation skills have been conducted in research areas linked to STEM education, to the best of our knowledge, few of these studies have examined the relationship between spatial reasoning and computational thinking. Given this gap in the literature, the present study investigates the role and action of spatial reasoning, and specifically the effects of mental rotation on computational thinking within an embodied and enacted perspective. To achieve this, we carried out a study involving 92 students in five primary-school classes (1st grade - 5th grade). The findings reveal a positive correlation between computational thinking skill and mental rotation ability. • Computational thinking is a high-level cognitive process closely connected to sensorimotor factors. • Complex processes underlying computational thinking emerge from concrete, situated, and action-based practices. • The findings reveal a positive correlation between computational thinking skill and mental rotation ability. • Gender does not influence the relationship between coding ability and mental rotation skills. • This relationship is quite stable among the different school grades of primary school.

10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103607,"As computational thinking (CT) is being embraced by educational systems worldwide, researchers and teachers have posed important questions such as ""what to teach"" and ""what can be learned."" These questions are universally crucial to the learning of all subjects. Nevertheless, there is no up-to-date, systematic overview of CT education for K-9 students that attempt to provide answers to these crucial questions. Thus, this systematic review presents a synthesis of 55 empirical studies, providing evidence of the development of computational thinking through programming in Scratch, one of the most popular visual block programming languages in schools. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine the CT skills that can be obtained through Scratch in K-9 based on empirical evidence. This systematic review has adopted Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework as the basis for defining and identifying the expected CT skills in K-9. The major findings entail what computational thinking skills students in K-9 can learn through Scratch in relation to the framework mentioned above, taking the progression of learning into account. Additional CT skills that are not captured by the framework were identified including input/output, reading, interpreting and communicating code, using multimodal media, predictive thinking, and human-computer interaction. These additional CT skills are not currently presented in Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework and can be considered as possible supplements to their framework. Furthermore, the paper discusses the difficulties regarding assessment and the progression of the identified skills, as well as problems with study designs. Finally, the paper sets out suggestions for future studies based on the current research gaps. • The paper identified computational thinking skills that can be obtained through Scratch in compulsory education. • The paper presented a quantitative analysis of the methodology of the empirical studies. • The paper described the learning challenges and difficulties associated with the identified computational thinking skills. • The paper provided an overview of the progression of the computational thinking skills according to the learners' ages. • The paper revealed some problems in scientific reporting.

10.5176/2251-2195_CSEIT17.68,"Teaching K-12 students computational thinking is the latest craze among scientists and is supposed to revolutionize critical thinking and improve the science, technology, engineering, and math interest pipeline. A slew of teaching plans, support materials, and curricula have been designed, developed, and promoted for use in classrooms worldwide. In this paper I argue that the foundations of computational thinking principles are sound and valid. However, the instructional approach is not transparent, developmentally appropriate, and lacks guiding scaffolds. One solution to these problems is to use a long-standing approach to strategic comprehension based on text structures - comparison, cause(s) for problem(s) and solution(s), sequence, and description. To showcase the usefulness of the text structures in computational thinking I present examples for every step of the Google computational thinking lessons explaining how the traditional approach can be made very useful to all students by including the teaching of text structures prior to or during computational thinking lessons.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103872,"The implementation of effective professional development courses for K-12 teachers on computational thinking (CT) in relation to programming remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development, technological content knowledge of the use of block-based programming environments for programming for CT development, and use of the environment to teach programming for CT development with the appropriate pedagogy in context. Analysis of the participants' self-reported reflections suggested that the two courses and the teaching experience acquired during the prolonged second course were the two main sources of improvement. This study demonstrates the importance of providing an effective teacher development program with a focus on CT concepts and practices. The program offers teachers a sustained period in which to practice in the classroom and reflect on their teaching while developing their capacity to implement CT in relation to programming. • A teacher development program for CT in relation to programming was designed and evaluated. • Teachers' CT concepts and practices improved consistently in the program. • In-service teachers attended the program and improved in all content-knowledge related TPACK dimensions. • A sustained period of active participation in programming activities was essential. • Opportunities to reflect on pedagogy in practicing CT in programming activities was important.

,"Computational geometry is a new (about 30 years) and rapidly growing branch of knowledge in computer science that deals with the analysis and design of algorithms for solving geometric problems. These problems typically arise in computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, robotics, manufacturing, knot theory, polymer physics and molecular biology. Since its inception many of the algorithms proposed for solving geometric problems, published in the literature, have been found to be incorrect. These incorrect algorithms rather than being 'purely mathematical' often contain a strong kinesthetic component. This paper explores the relationship between computational geometric thinking and kinesthetic thinking, the effect of the latter on the correctness and efficiency of the resulting algorithms, and their implications for education.

However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students' CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. It was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. Finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students' learning attitude toward CT better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes. • We developed an adaptive educational game for promoting computational thinking. • The game improved students' CT conceptual knowledge and skills. • The game improved students' learning attitude toward CT. • Students with lower prior knowledge benefited more from the game. • Students with higher prior learning attitude benefited more from the game.

First, an analysis of 23 activity reports sheds light on the main features of implementation efforts conducted by elementary school teachers from all over the country. Notably, compliance with official guidelines seems to have been prioritized over subject-specific contents, and, in some cases, the mere use of digital technologies in the classroom appears to be more relevant than programming and music-making goals. Following that, two key stakeholders – Japanese professionals engaged in planning and implementing <italic>programming</italic> in music in elementary schools – provide insights on its present state and future prospects through an open questionnaire. Their often-contrasting answers include perspectives on learning goals, teachers’ skills and assessment, as well as their expectations and concerns.

The work is self- sustainable through partnerships with recycling companies to commercialize materials that were not used at work, acting in environmental education, and allowing youth protagonism that seeks a solution for the development of school activities and generation of resources for the acquisition of components. electronics. Another solution that stands out is the recycling made by garbage collection from São Paulo that give rise to the construction of robots and electronics materials. The work became nationally and internationally recognized, breaking the paradigm of robotics teaching in Brazil by associating low-resource materials for the construction of prototypes. The work is currently a public policy in the state of São Paulo and is expanding in Argentina, the United States, London and France.

10.1016/j.chb.2019.106185,"Computational Thinking is a term applied to describe the increasing attention on students' knowledge development about designing computational solutions to problems, algorithmic thinking, and coding. It focuses on skills children develop from practicing programming and algorithms, and enables the development of qualities such as abstract thinking, problem solving, pattern recognition, and logical reasoning. Contemporary educational and infrastructural developments, like ""CS for All"" (https://www.csforall.org/), ISTE's Standards for Students in Computational Thinking (https://www.iste.org/explore/Solutions/Computational-thinking-for-all?articleid=152), Computer Science Teachers Association's Concepts of Computational Thinking (http://advocate.csteachers.org/2014/09/15/computational-thinking-and-beyond/), and the appearance of tools such as robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages posit Computational Thinking as a very promising area to support these learning competences. In this special issue of Computers in Human Behavior , the Editors report four studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams. The introduction to the special issue also draws attention to the great potential and need for further research in the area of Computational Thinking Education to engage students in meaningful learning so as to develop useful thinking skills and digital competences.

In addition to the overall effectiveness of the game, we investigated the impact of a specific game feature—constraints on the number of blocks in a solution. Results showed that after playing Penguin Go for less than two hours, students' CT skills improved significantly, but the additional constraints did not generate a significant impact on learning. In addition, the game overall did not influence students' attitudes toward computer science, but the constraints condition of the game negatively influenced students' attitudes toward computer science. Implications of the findings and possible directions for future research regarding using these types of games to foster computational thinking skills are discussed. • A quantitative evaluation of a video game targeting computational thinking. • Students' computational thinking skills improved significantly. • No significant impact on students' attitudes toward computer science. • Constraints on the number of blocks did not foster more learning. • Constraints on the number of blocks negatively affected students' CS attitudes.

10.1111/bjep.12429,"Background: Coding has been added to school curricula in several countries, being one of the necessary competencies of the 21st century. Although it has also been suggested to foster the development of several cognitive skills such as computational thinking and problem‐solving, studies on the effects of coding are very limited, provide mixed results, and lack causal evidence. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the impact of a learn‐to‐code programme on three cognitive skills in children: computational thinking, fluid intelligence, and spatial orientation, using a randomized trial. Sample: One hundred seventy‐four (n = 81 girls) 4th‐grade children participated in the study. Methods: Children were randomly assigned to one of the three 10‐week learning programmes: learn‐to‐code (treatment of interest), mathematics (another STEM‐related comparison treatment), and reading (control). Children responded to paper–pencil computational thinking, and spatial orientation measurements, and face‐to‐face matrix reasoning task at pre‐ and post‐tests. Results: Results showed that children's computational thinking scores increased significantly only in the learn‐to‐code condition. Fluid intelligence significantly increased in all conditions, possibly due to a practice effect. The spatial orientation did not improve in any of the conditions. Conclusion: These findings suggested that learning to code can be selectively beneficial for the development of computational thinking skills while not effective for spatial reasoning and fluid intelligence.

,"Simulation and modeling activities, a key point of computational thinking, are currently not being integrated into the science classroom. This paper describes a new visual programming tool entitled the Simulation Creation Toolkit. The Simulation Creation Toolkit is a high level pattern-based phenomenological approach to bringing rapid simulation creation into the classroom environment. Students create agent-based simulations via analogy between the real world phenomena they are trying to represent and ""interacticons,"" which are visual animations of generic agents enacting the phenomena. This approach obviates the need for students to implement low level and often time-consuming agent behavior programming and yet, requires the use of abstraction, which is a key component of computational thinking. Initial data shows that students in the classroom can implement simulations faster using the Simulation Creation Toolkit as compared to the end-user programming level and begins to show that students can use the Simulation Creation Toolkit to create simulations through analogical reasoning. In this sense, Simulation Creation toolkit provides an initial data point into the integration of Computational Thinking activities through simulation construction in the classroom environment.

10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103798,"With the increasing attention to Computational Thinking (CT) in education, there has been a concomitant rise of needs and interest in investigating how to assess CT skills. This study systematically reviewed how CT has been assessed in the literature. We reviewed 96 journal articles to analyze specific CT assessments from four perspectives: educational context, assessment construct, assessment type, and reliability and validity evidence. Our review results indicate that (a) more CT assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most CT assessments focus on students' programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess CT skills, and surveys are used to measure students' CT dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity evidence needs to be collected and reported in future studies. This review identifies current research gaps and future directions to conceptualize and assess CT skills, and the findings are expected to be beneficial for researchers, curriculum designers, and instructors. • A review of current CT assessments about context, construct, assessment type, and psychometric evidence. • Fewer CT assessments were examined in high school, college, and professional development than in elementary school. • Most CT assessments focused on students' programming or computing skills. • Traditional and portfolio assessments were often used to assess CT, and surveys were used to measure CT dispositions. • Half of the studies reported reliability and validity evidence of their CT assessment.

,"In early childhood, the curricular integration of computational thinking, programming, and robotics topics is ever more pressing. Therefore, preparing teachers and educators to implement this integration in the curriculum is fundamental. In the project «Laboratory of Technologies and Learning of Programming and Robotics in basic and preschool education in Portugal», the proposal of a MOOC was designed to meet this demand. This paper discusses aspects of the architecture of MOOCs, and their typologies, in the context of the challenges that the researchers encountered in the design process of the present MOOC. To do so, the Interaction Equivalency Theorem was considered, which equates the fundamental types of interaction to be considered in course design (learner-instructor; learner-content; learner-learner). Considering that learning design is both a process and a product the design of the MOOC is analysed in terms of its socio-technical context and systemic tensions present in work-based learning. Through a qualitative analysis of an individual interview and of a focus group, the paper describes formal and informal interactions and attempts to define a common vision, consensus, and divergences and contradictions that are part of the learning design process. Finally, the MOOC is presented, and its pedagogical design is substantiated.

10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105016,"Student-centered pedagogy (SCP) is highly considered for its potential to facilitate cognitive learning in Computational Thinking (CT) education. However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students' cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed. • Presents an integrative model bridging school support, pedagogy, and cognitive abilities from three levels of analysis. • Investigates how teachers' pedagogical strategy influences students' cognitive abilities via cognitive learning. • Explores relationships of active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning to predict cognitive abilities. • Underscores the value of school support for professional development in teachers' pedagogical strategy.

10.3390/ijms25094771,"This work aimed to describe the adsorption behavior of Congo red (CR) onto activated biochar material prepared from Haematoxylum campechianum waste (ABHC). The carbon precursor was soaked with phosphoric acid, followed by pyrolysis to convert the precursor into activated biochar. The surface morphology of the adsorbent (before and after dye adsorption) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), BET method, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and, lastly, pHpzc was also determined. Batch studies were carried out in the following intervals of pH = 4–10, temperature = 300.15–330.15 K, the dose of adsorbent = 1–10 g/L, and isotherms evaluated the adsorption process to determine the maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax, mg/g). Kinetic studies were performed starting from two different initial concentrations (25 and 50 mg/L) and at a maximum contact time of 48 h. The reusability potential of activated biochar was evaluated by adsorption–desorption cycles. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was 114.8 mg/g at 300.15 K, pH = 5.4, and a dose of activated biochar of 1.0 g/L. This study also highlights the application of advanced machine learning techniques to optimize a chemical removal process. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, a Gradient Boosting regression model was developed and fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization within a Python programming environment. The optimization algorithm efficiently navigated the input space to maximize the removal percentage, resulting in a predicted efficiency of approximately 90.47% under optimal conditions. These findings offer promising insights for enhancing efficiency in similar removal processes, showcasing the potential of machine learning in process optimization and environmental remediation.

10.1111/jcal.12591,"Over the past decade, the call to foster computational thinking (CT) in every child has received considerable attention. However, there is little understanding of whether children are developmentally ready to think computationally and what specific CT concepts and skills can be developed at various ages. This study explored the developmental and gender differences in CT skills of 197 Grade 4–6 students (aged 9–13) before being exposed to instruction and investigated the age–gender interaction effects on their CT acquisition in an intervention combining both programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities. Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender. Implications for practice and research in CT education were discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the topic: Learning progressions for computational thinking have been defined in K‐12 curricula globally.Engaging in programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities can increase students' CT skills.Controversial results have been reported on the age–gender interaction effects on CT development.Lack of understanding on children's actual progressive development of CT. What this paper adds: A developmental progression was found in CT skills of students aged 9–13. Students aged 12 and above had some a priori understanding of CT.No gender difference across ages existed in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills before instruction.Students aged 9–11 benefitted the most from an intervention combining both programming and unplugged activities compared to older students. Students' CT acquisition in the intervention was unaffected by gender.Given the intervention, students aged 9 and above developed conditionals, logical operators and pattern recognition skills. However, generalization skill was developed only for students aged 12 and above. Implications for practice and policy: The findings lay the foundation for designing evidence‐based age‐appropriate CT learning progression and pedagogies.Age‐appropriate learning content: Given appropriate learning experiences, students aged 9 and above may be ready to learn certain CT concepts and skills, including conditionals, logical operators and pattern recognition.CT pedagogies: Using programming and unplugged activities to develop CT requires careful consideration of students' cognitive development and gender needs.

10.1080/10494820.2019.1636090,"This study used robot-based practices to develop an activity that incorporated the 6E model. The sixth-grade students learned interdisciplinary knowledge about how to use Arduino electronic components, microcontrollers, and hands-on tools to make a ""Crab Robot."" In addition, the students learned how to use Scratch programming language to control the robot and complete the ""Crab Robot Crossing the Road"" task. The study implemented a quasi-experimental design to examine whether the students who learned the robot-based activity using the 6E model acquired better learning motivation, learning performance, computational thinking ability, and hands-on ability than those who learned the activity through lectures. This study adopted purposive sampling to select 70 sixth-grade students from four classes, which were divided into the experimental group (6E model) and the control group (lectures). The experiment was conducted over a period of 18 weeks (for a total duration of 1,440 minutes). The results from the pretests-posttests showed that both groups of students improved their learning motivation, learning performance, computational thinking ability, and hands-on ability; however, the experimental group's scores were significantly better. More importantly, this study provides a pedagogy manuscript for instructors who want to teach mechatronics programs and programming design education.

The unprecedented growth in data and emphasis on data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing full implementations of this in new statistics and data science programs and courses. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming datadriven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of datadriven inquiry.

,"This research emerged from the implementation in kindergarten context of the curriculum ""Powerful Ideas And The KIBO Robot Curriculum: The Traditional Children's Stories, for The Integration Of Programming And Robotics"" developed by (Miranda-Pinto, 2021) in a perspective of replicating this previously designed curriculum. Case study was usedto observe skills associated with computational thinking, in a specific group of pre-school children, having been implemented in June/July 2021, with a duration of 20 hours. The main data collection tool, Positive Technological Development framework (Bers, 2018); (Bers, 2012) was used to observe children's behavior in their activities with the KIBO robot. The results reveal maximum levels of the indicators of the various dimensions (6 «C´s»), which in preschool represents engagement and significant learning. However, this work would have had more consistent results if it had been developed during the whole school year, which is an ideal situation when integrating robotics into preschool curricular activities. Previous research (Miranda-Pinto et al., 2021) allowed us to understand that the most complex programming concepts can be worked on when the work progresses at a playful pace, parallel to the children's learning and gradually throughout the school year.

10.1111/jcal.12570,"In the last few years, programming, computational thinking, and robotics are more frequently integrated into elementary education. This integration can be done in many different ways. However, it is still unclear which teaching methods work in which situations. To provide some clarity in this area, we compared two methods of integrating programming into a primary robotics workshop for learners aged ten to twelve. In one method, students create programs from scratch; in the other, they start with a faulty program they have to fix. These teaching methods were evaluated using the framework of learning ecology, which provides a holistic framework for assessing complex learning environments. We identified different indicators of learning ecology and assessed our workshops using a mixed‐methods approach. Our results showed no difference between the groups on the intrinsic dimension of a learning ecology. However, on the experiential dimension, the learners in the create group scored better on all tests. Our results show the value of a multidimensional assessment of learning ecology to understand different teaching techniques. Additionally, the results provide us with important insights on how to integrate programming into a primary robotics curriculum enabling teachers to select better methods for teaching computing in their classroom. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: More and more countries are adding programming and computational thinking to their primary school curriculaTeacher need practical, efficient and effective ways to integrate programming into their coursesTeachers often opt for scaffolding techniques when teaching programming, however there is no conclusive research about which techniques work in which situations What this paper adds?: This research compares two methods for integrating programming into primary roboticsThese methods are evaluated using the intrinsic and experiential dimensions of learning ecology to get a deeper understanding of the underlying learning processesWe show that using learning ecology as a framework for learning can give deeper insights into learning practiceOur experiments show that integrating programming should preferably be done by letting learners create programs from scratch and not fix programs with errors Implications for practice and/or policy: Provide teachers with insights into the effects of different integration methods for programmingAllowing teachers to reason about why certain techniques are less effective than othersHanding teachers a framework for assessing the way they choose to integrate programming into their curriculum [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Computer Assisted Learning is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

10.1002/sce.21788,"Elementary teachers are tasked with the challenge of implementing Next Generation Science Standards‐aligned projects that integrate science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science (STEM + CS) in a variety of classroom contexts. This study investigates how teachers verbally support students in two classrooms, one general education class and one inclusive class with a larger proportion of students with individualized educational plans, to engage in a Next Generation Science Standards‐aligned, STEM + CS unit. Teachers' verbal support for students to understand how (pragmatic) and when and why (epistemic) to use practices was examined during whole‐class discussions for a 4‐week unit in science, engineering, and computer science‐focused lessons. Bi‐weekly teacher surveys and weekly teacher interviews provided insight into the teachers' perceptions of students and project activities in each class section. Teachers reported instructional decisions to modify their enactment of the interdisciplinary curricular materials for the Inclusive Class and discussed their rationales for these modifications. Results suggest that instructional decisions that teachers made in how to verbally support students may depend upon their own knowledge of the different disciplines being integrated, their prior beliefs of students in different classroom contexts, and their in‐the‐moment perceptions of student needs. These factors may have led to different learning experiences for the students in each class section. Findings underscore the need for more research to better understand what kinds of support students and teachers need to be able to integrate engineering, science, and computer science content and practices within their elementary classrooms and provide equitable learning opportunities for all students.

In particular, we introduce and illustrate a culturally responsive computing framework which served as a foundation for the design of the program. Subsequently, we examine youth collaboration as well as affective and cognitive learning outcomes. Data were collected from university program facilitators and 30 youth over one semester. Data were collected through observations, lesson plans, computational artifacts and interviews with two case study youth. Results indicated that youth formed a variety of learning communities during the collaborative development of computing artifacts. Frequent participants were found to work with a greater number of peers compared to less frequent participants. Results from case study participants also indicated improvements in their computational competencies.

Colleges and universities offer introductory CS courses every semester toward this end. The issue is centered on how to support CT learning in a large introductory CS course. To do it, an introductory CS course was designed to enrich CT by embedding short episodes of assessments to facilitate learning (AfL) and to support students' self‐regulated learning (SRL). This chapter begins by articulating the intricacies of the underlying processes of SRL, principles of AfL, and computational thinking practices in CS. Using the undergraduate introductory CS course referred to above, key practices of SRL and AfL will be illustrated to demonstrate how student learning of CS programming is structured with various online and offline supports. The chapter then concludes by appraising aspects of this CS course with practical suggestions for supporting student SRL and their learning of CS programming.

10.3233/EFI-230020,"The article presents an open educational resource (OER) to introduce humanities students to data analysis with Python. The article beings with positioning the OER within wider pedagogical debates in the digital humanities. The OER is built from our research encounters and committed to computational thinking rather than technicalities. Furthermore, we argue that students best learn with the 'whole game' methodology. Learners need to be exposed to meaningful activities as soon and as far as possible. The article presents two examples that implement our approach. The first introduces Python as a data analysis language to students of the humanities. It is different because it concentrates on the principles of the computational thinking behind data analysis rather than programming details. The second example takes the students into the world of machine learning and the whole game of social and cultural research with it. Students learn useful skills such as web scraping but will also run their own machine learning algorithms to follow concrete research questions.

Focusing on the use of counterexamples for developing student-invented algorithms, I reanalyze two pieces of data from previously published research, pertaining to two different cases of students' algorithmatizing activity. In both cases, after multiple iterations of testing and revising in response to counterexamples, the student(s) had not created a generalized algorithm. Going beyond a dichotomous right or wrong perspective, the analysis provides insights into how educators can build on the small nuanced revisions that students conduct on their algorithms, rather than expecting students to make one gigantic leap from an incorrect to a correct algorithm, and regarding the absence of such a leap as failure.

10.1515/jdis-2017-0011,"Due to the recent explosion of big data, our society has been rapidly going through digital transformation and entering a new world with numerous eye-opening developments. These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with 'information computing' disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula.

10.1007/s10798-024-09905-6,"Policy emphases on early childhood and elementary computer science education have led to the development of many developmentally appropriate computer science and robotics tools, pedagogies, and high-quality curricula. One example is the integrated Coding as Another Language pedagogy for coding, literacy, and social and emotional learning. The pedagogy was initially developed for students in kindergarten and early elementary school and has not previously been aligned to prekindergarten learning frameworks or used in the prekindergarten setting. In this paper, we describe a pilot program if the CAL pedagogy could be successfully used for the prekindergarten setting. The study used a design-based method to adapt the Coding as Another Language curriculum for the prekindergarten setting and a mixed-methods protocol to evaluate the program at a preschool site serving children experiencing homelessness in classrooms that are part of the local school district’s universal prekindergarten program. Students were assessed using the Coding Stages Assessment of coding knowledge and the TechCheck-PreK assessment of computational thinking. Teachers completed semi-structured interviews over the course of the project. Teachers reported overall positive experiences teaching the curriculum including for English language learners, although some reported challenges integrating the curricula in their bilingual classrooms. Children participating in the program significantly improved on their coding knowledge by 4.60 points on the Coding Stages Assessment, <italic>p</italic> < .0001. These findings suggest that the Coding as Another Language pedagogy can be successfully integrated with preschool learning frameworks and implemented in preschool classrooms.

However, the output-based assessment in BBPL learning is insufficient as we can not understand how students learn and what mistakes they have had. This study aims to propose a data-driven method that provides insight into students' problem-solving process in a game-based BBPL practice. Based on a large-scale programing dataset generated by 131,770 students in solving a classical maze game with BBPL in Hour of Code, we first conducted statistical analysis to extract the most common mistakes and correction trajectories students had. Furthermore, we proposed a novel program representation method based on tree edit distance of abstract syntax tree to represent students' programing trajectories, then applied a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to find the hidden patterns behind these trajectories. The experimental results revealed four qualitatively different clusters: quitters, approachers, solvers and knowers. The further statistical analysis indicated the significant difference on the overall performance among different clusters. This work provides not only a new method to represent students' programing trajectories but also an efficient approach to interpret students' final performance from the perspective of programing process.

Gaining an understanding of computational concepts as well as a high degree of student participation and commitment emphasize the effectiveness of introducing robotics and visual programming based on active methodologies in primary education. Implementation of this design provides sixth-grade elementary education students with activities that integrate programming and robotics in sciences and mathematics; these practices allow students to understand coding, motion, engines, sequences and conditionals. A quasi-experimental design, descriptive analysis and participant observation were applied across various dimensions to 93 sixth-grade students in four primary education schools. Programming and robotics were integrated in one didactic unit of mathematics and another in sciences. Statistically significant improvements were achieved in the understanding of mathematical concepts and in the acquisition of computational concepts, based on an active pedagogical practice that instills motivation, enthusiasm, commitment, fun and interest in the content studied.

,"We report about memory retrieval experiences to help students retrieve content they learned in class, retain it, and apply it in different contexts to solve novel problems. Supported by multiyear fall/spring professional development opportunities for teachers, these technological and pedagogical experiences range in complexity from simple electronic flashcards for basic retrieval strategies to low-stakes quizzes for spaced-out (initial exposure and retrieval effort are spaced out) and interleaved (two or more spaced-out topics are interleaved) practices. A sequential mixed-methods approach was used to collect quantitative data from a large number of participating teachers (N=180), followed by an enriched case study with a qualitative component to explore the meaning of the quantitative trends/findings in the first part of the study. Participants reported that they gained a greater understanding of the science behind the concept of interleaving, a greater understanding of how it can be implemented and tested in the classroom, and a higher level of confidence in the effectiveness of interleaving on knowledge retention than they had prior to training. While deployment of retrieval strategies in the classroom has been required of all participants, those who attended additional training in the summers (N=68) have also conducted Action Research to measure the effect of new strategies on learning. These teachers randomly selected control and target student groups within the same school, grade and course environment. They also self-selected an area of content within their respective science disciplines or mathematics curriculum and created two different retrieval practices - a blocked practice that examines student knowledge and skills for applying a certain method to the solution of various questions on only one topic or type, and the interleaved practice that involves questions on two or more topics that need different methods to solve. Results from the first summer cohort (N=16) show that students who learned math and science topics through interleaved practices consistently scored 5-30% better than those who learned it in the more traditional blocked practice. In many cases, the differences were statistically significant (p <0.05). While the second summer cohort (N=42) continues its action research, our future work will attempt to reduce confounding variables in research experiments and repeat them with more robust techniques and another level of memory retrieval strategy to help students not only recall what they learned in a classroom but also apply their content knowledge and computational skills to problem solving in a generative fashion beyond just answering multiple-choice questions.

10.1007/s10956-023-10028-1,"The emerging field of robotics education (RE) is a new and rapidly growing subject area worldwide. It may provide a playful and novel learning environment for children to engage with all aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. The purpose of this research is to examine how robotics learning activities may affect the cognitive abilities and cognitive processes of 6–8 years old children. The study adopted the mixed methods approach with a repeated measures design; three waves of data collection over 6 months, including quantitative data obtained from cognitive assessments and eye-tracking, and qualitative data from the interviews. A total of 31 children were recruited from an afterschool robotics program. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first RE research that used a combination of eye-tracking, cognitive assessments, and interviews for examining the effect of RE on children. Using linear growth models, the results of cognitive assessments showed that children's visuospatial working memory as well as logical and abstract reasoning skills improved over time. The interview data were analyzed by a thematic analysis. The results revealed that children perceived RE activities as game play, which made children more engaged in their study; parents found their children to be more focused on activities comparing to six months ago. Additionally, the visualization of the eye-tracking data suggested that children became more focused on RE activities and got faster to process the information across six months in general, which echoed the findings in assessments and interviews. Our findings may help educators and policymakers better understand the benefits of RE for young children.

10.5753/RBIE.2016.24.03.31,"Despite computing being virtually present in all sectors of our society, there is still a lack of knowledge and interest in learning about computing, in general due to the absence of the teaching of computing in elementary school. Teaching computing focusing only on digital literacy is no longer enough, as already in elementary school digital fluency need to be taught, including computational thinking and programming to prepare individuals adequately to deal with the challenges of the digital age. Thus, there is currently a global trend of concentrated efforts on computing education for this age group, and the multidisciplinary approach, combining computing to other disciplines already present within the scholar curriculum, has proven to be an efficient and effective way of teaching. In this context, the present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in elementary school in a multidisciplinary way, integrated in history classes, following the K-12 curriculum guidelines for computer education and using the Scratch environment. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is implemented and evaluated through a case study involving four classes in the fifth and seventh grades of an elementary school in Florianópolis/SC. The results indicate that the instructional unit and the use of Scratch enable the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an effective and entertaining way and attract the interest and motivation of students to this knowledge area. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Apesar da computação estar presente em praticamente todos os setores da sociedade, ainda existe uma carência de conhecimento e interesse no aprendizado dessa área, em grande parte devido à ausência do ensino da computação no Ensino Fundamental. Nesse sentido, o ensino focando somente na alfabetização digital não é mais suficiente, pois já no Ensino Fundamental precisa-se ensinar a proficiência digital, incluindo o pensamento computacional e a programação para preparar indivíduos a lidar com os desafios da era digital. Assim, existe atualmente uma tendência mundial de esforços concentrados no ensino de computação para esta faixa etária, sendo que a abordagem multidisciplinar, unindo a computação a outras disciplinas já inseridas no currículo escolar, tem se mostrado uma forma eficiente e eficaz de aprendizagem. Nesse contexto, a presente pesquisa propõe uma unidade instrucional para o ensino de computação no Ensino Fundamental de forma multidisciplinar, inserida na disciplina de História e estudos sociais, seguindo as diretrizes do currículo para o ensino de computação K-12 e usando Scratch como ferramenta. A unidade instrucional é desenvolvida seguindo uma abordagem de design instrucional e é aplicada e avaliada em um estudo de caso envolvendo quatro turmas no quinto e sétimo anos do Ensino Fundamental de uma escola em Florianópolis/SC. Os resultados observados indicam que a unidade instrucional e o uso do Scratch possibilitam a aprendizagem de conceitos básicos de computação (especificamente de programação) de forma eficaz e divertida e despertam o interesse e motivação dos alunos para esta área de conhecimento.

After that, we applied this resignification in an introductory programming workshop using visual programming and the BBC Micro:bit embedded device. Results from the workshop revealed that this gradual introduction could help novices in the programming concepts learning process, showing the potential of this approach in teaching programming.

Fifty-one students at a Boys and Girls Club participated in the study. Data collection procedures include pre- and post-tests, pre- and post-surveys, in-class observations, and one-on-one interviews. Results indicate that students have improved significantly on mathematical and computational concepts. They also tended to believe computer programming is fun, comprehensible, enjoyable, and were able to perceive the value of learning it. Implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed.

,"Hands-on activities can effectively engage students and promote learning. This paper presents the results of a one-week long summer camp for middle school students. The objective was to impact the attitudes of the participants towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The participants of the camp were from underrepresented groups from two rural school districts. The camp provided opportunities to the participants to learn programming of robots for a maze running competition. This activity was followed by learning how to program quadcopter drones. Several teams of participants then programmed their drones to fly an obstacle course to compete in a 'drone-derby'. The research design was a within-subject pre-post design. Participants of the camp were administered a validated math and science attitude survey at the beginning and after completion of the camp. This survey measured several dimensions of attitudes. The differences in attitudes between male and female participants were observed. In addition, a survey to determine the effectiveness of the camp was given to the students at the end of the camp. This work was supported by a grant from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

10.1007/s11528-018-0295-4,"The teaching of computing is becoming an essential addition to twenty-first-century learning. An important part of this new addition is the teaching of computing in earlier grades, starting as early as kindergarten in some countries. Yet, there is little research that reports on computing practices in earlier grades. The purpose of this study was to paint a broad picture of the teaching of computing in primary education from teachers' perspectives through a 20-min snowball survey sent out to elementary computing groups. This study reports on the teaching of over 300 teachers who are responsible for teaching computing to nearly 60,000 primary-aged students. The results principally represented teachers in the US and the UK, though smaller samples of teachers from 23 total countries are included. We report on teachers' responses by analyzing quantitative data and open-ended responses to questions about their experiences in teaching computing to children. Results highlight teachers' level of preparation to teach computing, the most commonly taught programming languages, teacher successes and challenges, and observations on how learning to program has affected students.

10.4403/jlis.it-12428,"Critical thinking on digital editions, and in particular scholarly editions, has been so far mainly focused on redefining the theoretical aspects developed in an analogical dimension, such as textual orientations, following a technological approach. In order to better understand the nature of digital editions it is also necessary to take into account aspects related to the theoretical dimension of computer science, since a technological approach, although initially justifiable, has several limitations due to the rapid and continuous changes in technology. For this reason, it is needful to apply other principles in the analysis and consideration of digital editions if we are to better understand their role in both Digital Humanities and in the dialogue between Humanities and the Hard Sciences, represented by the intertwining of narration and computation.

,"This article elaborates eight skills in future work which are based onthree main changes and are available to different domains of professions. The first change is an increasing technological world for the future. Technology becomes a part of human being's life and affects people's daily life. Mastering relevant competences is necessary to boost competitiveness. The first two skills in technological era arecomputational thinking and new-media literacy (Davies, Fidler, &Gorbis, 2011). Computational thinking and new-media literacy assistin both working effectively and building social network. In the domainof addressing function of brain, skill in relation with cognitive functionis strongly emphasize. Sense-making skill can influence people tolearn new knowledge, acquire information from phenomena, and makebetter choices. Sense-making is also working on many realms, such asbusiness (Ancona, 2012). There are three intelligences (social intelligence, emotional intelligence, cultural intelligence) which influence a person's career. In this article it mentions the definitions of the intelligences and the interrelationship among them. In addition, design usually impresses people by its visual effects and creative ideas. Design mindset skill has great power to help people solve problems more creativelyand efficiently (Tempore, 2013). Another similar skill is noveland adaptive thinking, which seeks more innovative thoughts and solutions. Managing cognitive load skill is also important for modem people who continually receive a mass of information. Cognitive load can negatively lead to distract person's attention. Fortunately, cognitiveload can be controlled by some ways (Bannert, 2002). Moreover, oursociety becomes diverse. Different race, different ethnic groups, anddifference cultures together build and affect our society. Cross-culturalcompetence is the basic skill for people to live better in the complexand global environment, including the sociability, intake of differentideas and understanding of the spirits from different cultures. All theseeight skills are cruxes to help you succeed in the future work.

10.15896/j.xjtuskxb.202306015,"Given that Chinese society is currently undergoing a comprehensive transitional phase characterized by intensifying stratification and conflicting interests among social classes, which has led to the increase of self-initiated events aimed at interest maintenance. The ensuing collective behaviors consequently pose considerable challenges to maintaining social order and stability in China. With the aim of adequately mitigating and forestalling potentially deleterious collective behavior. It is of great significance to study the evolutionary logic of collective behaviors under different circumstances, and thus provide a scientific reference for effectively controlling and preventing the malignant events of collective behaviors. The evolution of collective behaviors is a complex public-administration problem with nonlinear characteristics. Domestic scholars have put forward a series of explanatory frameworks for grassroots populace involvement in collective behaviors by integrating western theories with Chinese context.However, traditional methodologies of social science research can hardly understand the emergence characteristics and the overall structure of collective behaviors from the perspective of microcosmic units, and it is difficult to accurately analyze the specific social mechanism. Based on the existing theories and research of collective behaviors,and leveraging computational sociological thinking and approaches in an innovative manner,we firstly constructed a comprehensive interpretation framework generalizing the evolution of collective behavior into different dimensions of the rational-irrational and independent-influenced ones, and reconstructs the evolutionary logic of collective behaviors in theory combining with the discussion of information receiving and processing mechanism. Four kinds of the information diffusion mechanisms including the global-complete, local-complete, global-incomplete and local-incomplete evolutions were then formed. The complex network theory and information diffusion models in the field of social computing were further introduced, and the process of the evolved behaviors with the modeling and mathematical expression was built, and then a strong operational overall framework for systematically analyzing collective behaviors was formed. Secondly, under the guidance of the overall framework, the analysis framework and evolution models under different dimensions and diffusion mechanisms were constructed, and their specific process was also analyzed mathematically. The result shows that significant social influence and time limitation were identified as environmental constraints that prevent such self-correction and lead to unpredictability and path dependence of the system. In structured crowds, sparse networks facilitate the dissipation of collective behavior, while scale-free networks enhance the self-reinforcement of social influence. Based on the simulation of computer-generated parameters and the investigation data of migrant workers, the mechanisms of both generalization and specialization of collective behaviors were discussed. The scale-free network structure and formal network structure of migrant workers manifest similar characteristics in collective behavior evolution. Migrant workers at critical positions in the formal network have major impacts on the initiation of collective behavior.The research provides targeted perspectives for government agencies to develop contingency plans for collective behaviors as well as construct a modernized governance system led by the government with multi-stakeholder participation from enterprises, social organizations and citizens.

10.1080/15391523.2023.2232900,"Abstract One favored approach to teaching computational thinking (CT) and coding skills in PK-12 computer science education is to use educational physical computing and robotics devices (ePCRs). Marrying the physical functionalities and computer coding possibilities, ePCRs show great promise in cultivating PK-12 students’ CT and 21-st century skills. However, in practice, there is a lack of experienced teachers and readily-available ePCR curricula, which poses challenges in classroom integration. Thus, the purpose of this article is to analyze publicly-available ePCR math lesson plans designed for middle school students, especially focusing on lesson characteristics, instructional strategies, assessment plans, and 21st-century skills cultivated. After analyzing 283 publicly-available ePCR math lesson plans, we found that they used a variety of educational technologies. In particular, the majority utilize physical coding and the tools’ functionalities to move, draw, show visuals, and play audio. However, most of the lesson plans are in critical need of research-based instructional strategies and assessment plans and instruments. Our empirical evidence warrants a great need for additional research, design, and professional development in the area of effectively integrating ePCRs into content areas, especially in the aspects of active learning strategies, student-centered assessment, and more profound pedagogies to cultivate students’ 21st-century skills.

,"A first-year experience is critical for the long-term academic growth of a student. The literature is full of works that argue how important is the first-year experience. At Whitacre College of Engineering (WCE), we adopted the importance of having excellent and skilled-based experience in engineering students' first year. This paper provides a review of an engineering education practice, including teaching approaches and institutional strategies to support student success during their first college year. Undergraduate students in Whitacre College of Engineering (WCE) at Texas Tech University follow a common core curriculum in their first and second semesters of study. The First common First Year (FCY) curriculum was implemented in Fall2020 and formed to introduce certain basic skills to engineering students; and acquaint students with the interaction of skills, techniques, logic, and creativity in engineering problem formulation and solving. The FCY curriculum includes classical foundational studies in calculus, chemistry, physics, English, and new studies in computational thinking (programming/data science), Bioinspired engineering design class, and Ethics/humanities science. Since the first-year experience is critical in the long-term academic growth of a student, a plan was designed to integrate and advance what students are learning from the first common year to their sophomore, junior, and senior year with more emphasis, given to programming/data science, Bio-inspired engineering design class, and ethics & humanities. To effectively integrate these courses into the upper-level courses, a group of faculty members from different engineering departments, called disciples, were designated. The main duties of these disciples are: 1. providing relevant examples from each engineering major related to computational thinking, bio-inspired design, ethics, and humanities to the faculty members teaching the common first year (FCY). 2. monitoring the advancement and integration of First common year (FCY) newly added courses through sophomore (second year), junior (third year), and senior years (fourth year). 3. Evaluating the impact of the newly added courses on the attainment of ABET student outcomes 1-7. An example of how the FYC content is carried out and integrated into the petroleum engineering curriculum is presented in this paper. Furthermore, the paper shows how ABET student outcomes were mapped to these courses.

10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.010,"Abstract This study examines the impact of grouping by gender and group roles on robotics performance, computational thinking skills, and learning motivation towards computer programming. One hundred ninety-one students in fourth and fifth grade completed the project. LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics were used to compose and program music in groups of three to four students. The robotics project was completed over the course of fourteen weeks for 1 h each week. Gender-structured groups of all female, all male and mixed female and male were randomly assigned in each class. All groups in participating six classrooms were assigned one of three group roles implementation, which were fixed, rotating and no role. This study is significant towards identifying group scaffolds and supports that can produce benefits for all students in robotic activities. Results indicated that group roles matter when students are working on collaborative robotics projects. Three different implementations of group roles in robotics activities demonstrated an impact on robotics performance scores. Gender composition of the group did not impact groups' robotics performance. Group roles also impacted student computational thinking skills, while gender composition of the group still demonstrated no significant difference. Finally, while group roles demonstrated a difference in learning motivation towards computer programming, gender composition demonstrated no difference in learning motivation towards computer programming. Highlights • Group composition matters when students are working on collaborative robotics projects. • Group roles have impacts on student computational thinking skills and robotics performances. • Group roles have no impact on learning motivation towards computer programming. • Gender did not impact groups' robotics performance and computational thinking skills. • Gender did not impact learning motivation towards computer programming.

There are moves in other countries to this effect such as the U.S. K-12 Computer Science Framework (CSF) for development. Debates on how to program and what constitutes computational thinking are ongoing. Here we report on a study of programing by children aged 7 - 11 using Java and elements of computational thinking they experience. Our platform comprises a novel Story-Writing-Coding engine we have developed. We compare novice (children's) processes of coding an animated story with that of experts (college students) and evaluate the differences using four measures based on the progressive coding of a complete program. We also analyze the use of novice (children's) computational thinking in this coding process. This research is set against a backdrop of approaches to teaching programing and concepts of computational thinking in recent educational literature.

10.1007/s10956-019-09800-z,"Computational thinking (CT) and modeling are authentic practices that scientists and engineers use frequently in their daily work. Advances in computing technologies have further emphasized the centrality of modeling in science by making computationally enabled model use and construction more accessible to scientists. As such, it is important for all students to get exposed to these practices in K-12 science classrooms. This study investigated how a week-long intervention in a regular middle school science classroom that introduced CT and simulation-based model building through block-based programming influenced students' learning of CT and force and motion concepts. Eighty-two seventh-grade students from a public middle school participated in the study. Quantitative data sources included pre- and post-assessments of students' understanding of force and motion concepts and CT abilities. Qualitative data sources included classroom observation notes, student interviews, and students' reflection statements. During the intervention, students were introduced to CT using block-based programming and engaged in constructing simulation-based computational models of physical phenomena. The findings of the study indicated that engaging in building computational models resulted in significant conceptual learning gains for the sample of this study. The affordances of the dynamic nature of computational models let students both observe and interact with the target phenomenon in real time while the generative dimension of model construction promoted a rich classroom discourse facilitating conceptual learning. This study contributes to the nascent literature on integrating CT into K-12 science curricula by emphasizing the affordances and generative dimension of model construction through block-based programming.

10.1007/s10956-019-09805-8,"Integrating computational thinking (CT) and science education is complex, and assessing the resulting learning gains even more so. Arguments that assessment should match the learning (Biggs, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 21(1), 5–16. 1996; Airasian and Miranda, Theory into Practice, 41(4), 249–254. 2002; Hickey and Zuiker, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(4), 522–582. 2012; Pellegrino, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 49(6), 831–841. 2012; Wiggins, Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation, 2(2). 1990) lead to a performance-oriented approach to assessment, using tasks that mirror the integrated instruction. This approach reaps benefits but also poses challenges. Integrated CT is a new approach to learning. Movement is being made toward understanding what it means to operate successfully in this context, but consensus is neither general nor time tested (Kaput and Schorr, Research on technology and the teaching and learning of mathematics: Case and perspectives (Vol. 2, pp. 211–253) 2008). Movement is also being made toward developing methods for assessing CT. Despite the benefits of matching assessment with pedagogy, there may be intrinsic losses. One problem is that interactions between the two domains may invalidate the results, either because the gains in one may be easier to measure at certain times than the gains in the other, or because interactions between the two domains may cause measurement interference. Our examination draws upon both theoretical basis and also existing practices, particularly from our own work integrating CT and secondary science. We present a mixed-methods analysis of student assessment results and consider potential issues with moving too quickly toward relying on a rubric-based approach to evaluating this student learning. Centrally, we emphasize the importance of assessment approaches that reflect one of the most important affordances of computational environments, that is, the expression of multiple ways of knowing and doing (Turkle and Papert, Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 11(1), 3–33. 1992).

10.1007/s10956-019-09795-7,"In recent years, the field of education has challenged researchers and practitioners to incorporate computing as an essential focus of K-12 STEM education. Integrating computing within K-12 STEM supports learners of all ages in codeveloping and using computational thinking in existing curricular contexts alongside practices essential for developing mathematical and scientific expertise. In this paper, we present findings from a design-based, microgenetic study in which an agent-based programming and computational modeling platform—ViMAP—was integrated with existing elementary science and math curricula through lessons co-designed and taught by the classroom teacher across a period of seven months. We present a dialogical re-positioning of coding, where disciplinarily grounded meanings of code emerge through the construction of computational utterances––i.e., computer models as well as complementary conversations and physical models that serve as mathematical and scientific explanations––through the use of socio-mathematical norms.

To this end, two studies have been carried out. The first one involves a survey about how ecology-related and computational design courses complement the architectural design studio at different universities in Turkey. The second one, which is the main study of this paper, presents the results of an ecology-based computational design workshop. According to the results of the first study, computer-based design courses in Turkey usually lack the dimension of ""computational thinking"", focusing only on computer-aided design tools. Moreover, we have also found out that ecology courses in Turkish architectural education are mostly elective, and hence, have only very indirect connection to the architectural design studio. In the second study, we have demonstrated how incorporating computational thinking into the design process increase students' awareness of the ecological dimension and their ability to make this dimension an integral part of their projects. The paper concludes by elaborating on the importance of computational methods in architectural education.

10.1177/01614681221103932,"Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls' self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.

10.1016/j.cag.2022.01.002,"The ubiquity of smartphone and tablet devices, combined with the increasing availability of serious games, has enabled students to learn various abstract concepts in an appealing and convenient manner. While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players' qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work. • Design and evaluation procedures for an Augmented Reality-based serious game to teach programming are presented. • An empirical study with twenty-seven undergraduate students is conducted. • Students with lesser prior programming skills show significant improvement after playing the game. • A Game Learning Analytics framework is incorporated in the game for various stakeholder benefits. • Suggestions and implications for future work are presented.

However, there is a lack of evidence about how to teach computational modelling in biology and what the effects are on student learning. The purpose of this intervention-control study was to investigate how knowledge in computational modelling is associated with knowledge acquisition in biology. Participants were 118 students (17 to 19 years of age) enrolled in first and second year of Danish High School. The intervention group (n = 81) received teaching in biology and computational modelling while the comparison group (n = 37) received teaching in biology using textbook models. Both groups received two sessions, each of approximately 120 minutes. The study used mixed methods to analyse students' knowledge of biology and computational modelling. Participants in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvements in their biological knowledge and computational modelling knowledge. The study is one of the first to investigate the effect of computational modelling on high school students' learning of biology. The study discusses how biology could be an important subject where students can learn computing concepts central in the endeavour to introduce computing in high school education.

10.1080/13869795.2024.2332171,"Recent years have seen a surge of interest in applying mechanistic thinking to computational accounts of implementation and individuation. One recent extension of this work involves so-called 'wide' approaches to computation, the view that computational processes spread out beyond the boundaries of the individual. These 'mechanistic accounts of wide computation' maintain that computational processes are wide in virtue of being part of mechanisms that extend beyond the boundary of the individual. This paper aims to further develop the mechanistic account of wide computationalism by responding to two outstanding worries, what are called the parsimony and testability challenges. The first is based on considerations about wide computation's ontological cost; the second the view's experimental testability. The argument is that wide mechanistic computationalism can gain the necessary conceptual resources to address the challenges by embracing two further aspects of the mechanistic approach: (i) the structural aspect of mechanistic explanation and (ii) the notion of constitutive relevance.

10.1080/02635143.2022.2121693,"Background and Purpose: As a growing number of instructional units have been developed to promote young children's scientific and engineering practices (SEPs), understanding how to evaluate and assess children's SEPs is imperative. However, paper-and-pencil assessments would not be suitable for young children because of their limited reading and writing skills. To explore the assessments for SEPs available for young children aged 3–8 years, this study reviewed assessments of young children's SEPs reported in empirical studies, and analysed the characteristics of these assessments to delineate how young children's SEPs have been measured. Methods: We followed the procedures of a systematic review proposed by Zawacki-Richter et al. (2020). The EBSCOhost database was used to gather empirical studies in education and psychology. A total of 46 articles published from 2003 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings: The findings indicated that of the eight SEPs suggested by the National Research Council (2012), Analysing and interpreting data was assessed the most, followed by Using mathematics and computational thinking, Constructing explanations and designing solutions, and Planning and carrying out investigations. A majority of assessments were designed for children of 4, 5, and 6 years old and used paper-based visualizations and real objects to present the tasks and items. Additionally, due to the verbal or performance nature of the SEPs, the assessments collected different types of data as evidence to evaluate children's SEPs. Performance-based assessments were the most common, followed by multiple-choice, ranking, and oral responses. Conclusion: The findings of the reviewed assessments revealed a variety of performance expectations of SEPs and suggested that some SEPs are measurable and developmentally appropriate for young children. Also, the availability of assessments is uneven in different types of SEPs, and more assessments for information communication and modelling practices are needed.

While there exists a substantial body of research on CM case design and practical applications, a notable gap exists in systematic reviews of these studies. Although systematic reviews of computational thinking in science classrooms exist, they diverge from the definition of CM, often omitting pertinent articles. This study adhered to the standardized process of systematic literature review, selecting Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus as the databases. It established search keywords and criteria for the inclusion and exclusion of literature. After multiple rounds of screening, this study ultimately obtained 70 works related to CM. For the results, this study begins with an analysis of publication distribution, research popularity trends, research types, and methodologies. Subsequently, it delves into participant profiles, encompassing their geographical distribution, educational levels, and sample sizes. Furthermore, it scrutinizes case types, modeling tools, and the fundamental functionalities within case design. Lastly, it explores the scientific disciplines and student competencies that researchers prioritize in CM’s practical application, along with the evaluation methods, collected data, and core empirical findings. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for future research directions, catalyzing deeper exploration within the field.

10.1002/wcs.1679,"Cognitive science was founded on the idea that the mind/brain can be understood in computational terms. While computational modeling in science is ubiquitous, cognitive science takes the stronger stance that the mind/brain literally performs computations. Moreover, performing computations is crucial to explaining what the mind/brain does, qua mind/brain. Unfortunately, most scientists fail to consider analog computation as a legitimate and theoretically useful type of computation in addition to digital computation; to the extent that analog computation is acknowledged, it is mostly based on a simplistic and incomplete understanding. Taking computation to consist of only one type (i.e., digital) while ignoring another, interestingly distinct type (i.e., analog) leads to an impoverished understanding of what it could mean for minds/brains to compute. A full appreciation and understanding of analog computation—particularly in relation to digital computation—allows researchers to develop computational frameworks and hypotheses in new and exciting ways. Thus, somewhat counterintuitively, looking to the once‐dominant computing paradigm of yesteryear can provide novel computational ways of thinking about the mind and brain.

,"Current P-12 science [1] and engineering education [2] standards call for the integration of computational thinking (CT) within authentic, design-based engineering contexts [3-5]. Physical computing has been proposed as a viable option for applying CT concepts through the engineering design process [6-8]. In addition, some studies have found that physical computing design challenges can influence female students' attitudes toward computing and engineering (e.g., e-textile activities have been found to be more engaging to female students). However, there is limited research examining the influence that physical computing professional development (PD) has on U.S. educators, especially regarding differences between male and female teachers. Therefore, this study investigated how male and female teachers' attitudes toward computing differed after participating in a physical computing PD experience. The Computing Attitude Questionnaire (CAQ) [9] was used to examine the computing attitudes of 37 (13 males and 24 females) grades 4-8 educators. The results revealed that male and female teachers reported significant increases across numerous attitude constructs. Unlike male participants, females reported significant increases in their comfort with physical computing and attitude toward applying physical computing in their classes. However, when comparing the gains reported by males and females, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Supplemental post-survey questions revealed that while most participants indicated they plan to integrate more physical computing concepts within their courses, no significant differences existed between male and female teachers' intentions to integrate such concepts. This study contributes to the limited literature on P-12 physical computing research within the U.S. It has implications for improving physical computing PD efforts offered by higher education institutions and engineering education programs. Moreover, it provides some insight into males' and females' attitudes toward physical computing, which can help inform the planning of future physical computing design challenges and PD opportunities.

,"With the fourth industrial revolution well underway, the proportion of occupations requiring ""high"" or ""medium"" digital skills has never been greater. Among those most in demand are engineers skilled in computing and advanced problem solving to support the ongoing digitalization, networking, and automation. A numerical analysis course in the core undergraduate engineering curriculum is a natural place for students to learn numerical methods for advanced problem solving across engineering applications. The use of computing across the entire chemical engineering curriculum also offers opportunities to hone students' abilities as computational thinkers and effective problem solvers to meet the current and future needs of an increasingly complex and digital industry and society. While the current chemical engineering curriculum includes computational training, there is a need to efficiently increase the exposure of students to computing within mathematical problem-solving contexts and develop their proficiency in computer programming, all while balancing demands to reduce credit hours. Some chemical engineering faculty interested in enhancing the computational nature of their courses face a barrier to doing so due to unfamiliarity with some modern computational educational resources that may not have been covered in their training or may not be used in their research areas. The authors developed a workshop to teach chemical engineering faculty to use and develop interactive coding templates (MATLAB Live Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks) and to equip faculty to incorporate these techniques across the undergraduate curriculum. The workshop was presented at the 2022 ASEE/AIChE Summer School for Engineering Faculty. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the workshop resources, providing educators with a suite of interactive templates focused on chemical engineering-related case studies and with training to create and adapt their own related materials. The paper details the interactive coding templates provided during the workshop along with the relevant pedagogical background and some lessons learned for future related workshops. Educators who did not attend the workshop are also a target audience of this paper as it provides tips and access to the relevant materials for implementing computational thinking through interactive coding templates into their classroom practices.

,"Effective development of children's computational thinking (CT) skills necessitates their exposure to experiences that require the application of CT to build technological solutions. However, the integration of technology into early childhood education is often challenging due to concerns about potential harm to young children. This paper presents a best-practices technology framework constructed from the contributions of early childhood professional organizations and experts. The framework consists of nine elements (Child, Pedagogy, Context, Content, Facilitators, Environment, Evaluation, Tools & Innovations, and Screen Time) that must be understood in the context of technology usage to intentionally extend and complement early childhood learning while minimizing its harm. In addition, the paper proposes a holistic view of technological classification, age groups around technology usage, and input-device literacy.

10.15388/Informatica.2017.119,"Computational thinking is an increasingly important focus in computer science or informatics curricula around the world, and ways of incorporating it into the school curricula are being sought. The Bebras contest on informatics, which originated 12 years ago and now involves around 50 countries, consists of short problem-solving tasks based on topics in informatics. Bebras tasks engender the development of computational thinking skills by incorporating abstraction, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, evaluation and generalization. Bebras tasks cover a range of informatics concepts including algorithms and data structures, programming, networking, databases and social and ethical issues. Having built up a substantial number of Bebras tasks over 12 years it is important to be able to categorize them so that they can be easily accessed by the Bebras community and teachers within schools. The categorization of tasks within Bebras is important as it ensures that tasks span a wide range of topics; there have been several categorization schemes suggested to date. In this paper we present a new two-dimensional categorization system that takes account of computational thinking skills as well as content knowledge. Examples are given from recent tasks that illustrate the role that Bebras can play in the development of computational thinking skills.

Complex systems thinking become instrumental for the modern understanding basis of life sciences in general and, hence, medicine and public health. In this perspective paper, we discuss recent literature and invite readers to explore the utility of complex thinking to properly addressing the constrained-based analysis of high-profile open questions in biomedicine with straightforward implications on public health. Recommendations are then proposed to encourage new multidisciplinary teams to come together in a timely manner in response to novel challenges in the theoretical physiology arena. We conclude that there is the need for far greater attention to the issue of complexity to aptly cope with a new array of problems that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

10.1007/s13384-024-00716-1,"To prepare young people for the increasingly complex and fluid world of their future, many countries have begun introducing digital technologies concepts and skills into their curricula. In 2017, the New Zealand National Curriculum was updated to incorporate digital technologies concepts in both the indigenous Māori-medium curriculum and the English-medium curriculum. This study investigated the long-term impact of three different models of digital technologies in professional learning and development on primary and intermediate schoolteachers’ knowledge and efficacy beliefs (value beliefs, self-efficacy beliefs and teaching efficacy beliefs). Professional learning and development were found to have a positive long-term impact on teachers’ digital technologies knowledge and efficacy beliefs, yet no one professional learning and development model was found to be more effective than another. Post professional learning and development, teachers were found to want more support on how to plan for Digital Technologies curricula implementation and fully adopt twenty-first-century pedagogical practices. School environments were shown to influence efficacy beliefs, and a lack of time in the classroom to plan for and upskill in digital technologies was reported. Limitations of the study are discussed, and areas for future research are identified.

10.59188/eduvest.v3i6.835,"Particularly in light of the COVID-19 epidemic, technology is a catalyst for changing teaching and learning, not just a tool for providing information. This essay aims to examine the three ways that personalization, relevance, and skill development might affect the teaching profession. This research is a qualitative research and library research. The capacity of educators to adapt learning experiences to the needs, interests, and preferences of each student is referred to as personalization. By giving users access to data, material, and the cloud, technology may enable personalization and allow teachers to track student progress, differentiate their lessons, and give feedback. Technology can enable students to take control of their education and choose their own speed and direction. Relevance is the relationship between what students are learning and their personal objectives, ambitions, and aspirations. By establishing blended learning settings that include online and offline activities, real-world challenges, and realistic assignments, technology may increase relevance. Students may engage with classmates and professionals, access materials outside of the classroom, and apply what they have learned in many circumstances with the use of technology. The development of students' skills includes preparing them for the workforce and culture of the twenty-first century. By introducing kids to contemporary technology tools and abilities including coding, programming, physical computing, and computational thinking, technology may promote skill development. Through maker education and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education, technology can also encourage students to develop their problem-solving, critical thinking, collaborative, and creative skills.

10.3233/EFI-230027,"The combination of the quantitative turn in linguistics and the emergence of text analytics has created a demand for new methodological skills among linguists and data scientists. This paper introduces KNIME as a low-code programming platform for linguists interested in learning text analytic methods, while highlighting the considerations necessary from a linguistics standpoint for data scientists. Examples from an Open Educational Resource created for the DiMPAH project are used to demonstrate KNIME's value as a low-code option for text analysis, using sentiment analysis and topic modelling as examples. The paper provides detailed step-by-step descriptions of the workflows for both methods, showcasing how these methods can be applied without writing code. The results suggest that visual or low-code programming tools are useful as an introduction for linguists and humanities scholars who wish to gain an understanding of text analytic workflows and computational thinking. However, as with more traditional programming, caution must be exercised when using methods without fully understanding them. In conclusion, KNIME is a potential avenue for innovative research and teaching computational methods to humanities scholars.

10.3390/math9111197,"The steepest descent (or ascent) algorithm is one of the most widely used algorithms in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). However, this powerful mathematical tool is neither taught nor even mentioned in K12 education. We study whether it is feasible for elementary school students to learn this algorithm, while also aligning with the standard school curriculum. We also look at whether it can be used to create enriching activities connected to children's real-life experiences, thus enhancing the integration of STEM and fostering Computational Thinking. To address these questions, we conducted an empirical study in two phases. In the first phase, we tested the feasibility with teachers. In a face-to-face professional development workshop with 457 mathematics teachers actively participating using an online platform, we found that after a 10-min introduction they could successfully apply the algorithm and use it in a couple of models. They were also able to complete two complex and novel tasks: selecting models and adjusting the parameters of a model that uses the steepest descent algorithm. In a second phase, we tested the feasibility with 90 fourth graders from 3 low Socioeconomic Status (SES) schools. Using the same introduction and posing the same questions, we found that they were able to understand the algorithm and successfully complete the tasks on the online platform. Additionally, we found that close to 75% of the students completed the two complex modeling tasks and performed similarly to the teachers.

Although various studies have been conducted on this topic, very few have examined Japanese elementary school computational thinking in terms of the developmental stages of elementary school children. Thus, we developed programming learning materials using concrete objects that can be understood by lower-elementary students. Specifically, we divided program-oriented thinking into three steps: concrete, logical, and abstract thinking; we then made the pupils carry out work in this order to encourage them to think of the sequence of actions necessary to implement the intended act, which involved the measurement and control of an illumination system.

10.1109/TE.2020.3030588,"Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.

Integrating arts in education can lead to the design of activities using Scratch combined with devices. The main goal is to evaluate the integration of computational thinking in art education making use of technological resources, sensor cards and minicomputers, with a student-centred pedagogical approach. This research assesses the results of a control group of 35 students and an experimental group of 109 students in four different schools, using Mann-Whitney’sU-test for independent samples assessing ‘Active Learning’, ‘computational concepts’ and ‘fun’ scales. Applying data triangulation, and consistent with design-based research, the results of interviews and focus groups reinforced the results obtained in the aforementioned test, providing validity to the study. There are advantages regarding student interest, motivation and commitment related to programming technologies in art and education, particularly pedagogical sessions with music. Handling devices, sensors and Raspberry Pi provides participating students with a factor of commitment and enthusiasm, with significant improvements. Working with coding and devices brings an additional advantage in the development of computational thinking and digital competence. The results show an increase in creativity and artistic competence related to the ability to create music from the activities and technological resources described in the technological intervention.

10.5753/RBIE.2021.29.0.440,"Educational Robotics is a relatively new field that has the potential to bring the student's reality closer to educational content, especially when active learning methodologies are used and multiple areas of knowledge are integrated. In this perspective, given the lack of teacher training solutions in computing and automation, we present in this work an Online Workshop on Introduction to Educational Robotics for teacher training. The objective of this workshop was to promote a reflection and reorientation of innovation strategies for educational practices, preparing teachers to mediate creative learning from the concepts of computational thinking in the development of small robotic projects. This proposal was designed with the Flipped Classroom methodology, but due to the impossibility of performing face-to-face activities because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we redefine the use of this methodology for one for the context of remote teaching of Educational Robotics. In this way, teacher training was carried out entirely online with activities distributed in synchronous and asynchronous moments and with the robotics practices carried out in the Tinkercad online simulator. The results obtained point to relevant points in the practice of remote teaching of robotics that may have a positive impact on the students' learning process, since the practices in robotics led to the understanding and reflection of the steps in solving problems based on Computational Thinking.

Nessa perspectiva, diante da carência de soluções de formação de professores em computação e automação, apresentamos neste trabalho uma Oficina Online de Introdução à Robótica Educacional para formação de professores. O objetivo dessa oficina foi promover uma reflexão e reorientação de estratégias de inovação para as práticas educativas preparando professores para a mediação de uma aprendizagem criativa a partir dos conceitos do Pensamento Computacional no desenvolvimento de pequenos projetos robóticos. Essa proposta foi pensada com a metodologia de Sala de Aula Invertida, mas devido à impossibilidade de realização de atividades presenciais por causa da pandemia de Covid-19, ressignificamos o uso dessa metodologia para um o contexto de ensino remoto de Robótica Educacional. Dessa forma, a formação de professores foi realizada totalmente online com atividades distribuídas em momentos síncronos e assíncronos com as práticas de robótica no simulador online Tinkercad. Os resultados obtidos apontam para pontos relevantes da prática de ensino remoto de robótica que poderão impactar positivamente no processo de aprendizagem dos alunos, uma vez que as práticas em robótica levaram à compreensão e à reflexão dos passos na resolução de problemas a partir do Pensamento Computacional.

10.1111/jcal.13025,"Background Objective Method Results Conclusion Stealth assessment is a learning analytics method, which leverages the collection and analysis of learners' interaction data to make real‐time inferences about their learning. Employed in digital learning environments, stealth assessment helps researchers, educators, and teachers evaluate learners' competencies and customize the learning experience to their specific needs. This adaptability is closely intertwined with theories related to learning, engagement, and motivation. The foundation of stealth assessment rests on evidence‐cantered design (ECD), consisting of four core models: the Competency Model (CM), Evidence Model, Task Model, and Assembly Model.The first step in designing a stealth assessment entails producing operational definitions of the constructs to be assessed. The CM establishes a framework of latent variables representing the target constructs, as well as their interrelations. When developing the CM, assessment designers must produce clear descriptions of the claims associated with the latent variables and their states, as well as sketch out how the competencies can be measured using assessment tasks. As the designers elaborate on the assessment model, the CM definitions need to be revisited to make sure they work with the scope and constraints of the assessment. Although this is the first step, problems at this stage may result in an assessment that does not meet the intended purpose. The objective of this paper is to elucidate the necessary steps for CM development and to highlight potential challenges in the process, along with strategies for addressing them, particularly for designers without much formal assessment experience.This paper is a methodological exposition, showcasing five examples of CM development. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative retrospective analysis of the CM development procedure, wherein participants unfamiliar with ECD applied the framework and showcased their work. In a stealth assessment course, four groups of students (novice stealth assessment designers) engaged in developing stealth assessments for challenging‐to‐measure constructs across four distinct projects. During their CM development process, we observed various activities to pinpoint areas of difficulty.This paper presents five illustrative examples, including one for assessing physics understanding and four for the development of CMs for four complex competencies: (1) systems thinking, (2) online information credibility evaluation, (3) computational thinking, and (4) collaborative creativity. Each example represents a case in CM development, offering valuable insights.The paper concludes by discussing several guidelines derived from the examples discussed. Emphasizing the importance of dedicating ample time to fine‐tune CMs can significantly enhance the accuracy of assessments related to learners' knowledge and skills. It underscores the significance of qualitative phases in crafting comprehensive stealth assessments, such as CMs, alongside the quantitative statistical modeling and technical aspects of these assessments.

With research pointing out the importance of a conscious language use in STEM teaching, we here focus on words used by teachers and children during inquiry-based STEM activities in five different preschools. Bers' powerful ideas about early childhood computational thinking (Bers 2018. Coding as a Playground. New York: Routledge.) were used for analysis and results highlight how digital programming and use of robots can promote a more versatile use of robotic words, compared to analogue, 'unplugged', programming without robots. Furthermore, it is also found that use of precise decontextualised language by the teacher seems to stimulate children's use of words related to STEM and the object of learning. The findings add to the discussion about how teachers can scaffold children's learning by inquiry teaching of STEM supported by robotics.

10.1080/02635143.2022.2103108,"Integrated STEM approaches are acknowledged as important for making school subjects relevant and engaging for students and are reinforced with the current emphasis on computational thinking. Still, such approaches are rarely realized in schools. This study investigates how the traditional 'grammar of schooling' may prevent realization of more holistic teaching in line with ideas from integrated STEM. A concrete teaching project where students design, program and build their own weather station is presented, and we investigate the values and challenges teachers see in the project and the obstacles that may prevent them from running it in class. This way it throws light on why STEM approaches may be difficult to realize in schools. The sample consists of teachers involved in a collaborative project in which Project Weather Station was developed, including the teacher who was undertaking the project in his grade 9 class. The study follows a case study design, with group interviews with teachers. Observation in class, video recording and interviews with students form a backdrop of the main interview data. Results show that teachers see value in the weather station project in line with the overarching aims of the curriculum and consistent with STEM ideas. Challenges they see are related to own competence, time use, risk of failure and logistics across subjects. It is concluded that teachers' challenges reflect a tension between overarching aims in education and the more specific competence aims in the curriculum. On a systemic level there is therefore a need for an acceptance for the value of teaching that targets overarching aims of education. It is important to acknowledge teachers' challenges and fulfil their needs for support when undertaking extensive projects that have potential for realising the more holistic aims of education typical for STEM projects.

10.1080/10447318.2022.2163783,"In order to cultivate children's computational thinking, researchers have developed many excellent programming systems. Among them, the tangible programming systems combined with graphic output have been widely accepted because of the intuitive input method and diversified visual feedback. However, few of them support collaborative learning or programming. Little is known about children's experiences, emotional states and behaviours on collaborative programming. Motivated by this gap, we present a novel tangible and collaborative enabled programming system named Lighters, which designed for children aged 7–10 and had two types of collaboration modes (block-based and role-based). We conducted an user experiment with 24 children, and collected physiological (EDA), questionnaire, video recording and interview data for analysis. Based on our experiment results, Lighters are effective in helping children learn to program collaboratively. In addition, Lighters can mobilize children's positive emotions and enthusiasm to learn programming. Compared with block-based collaboration, role-based collaboration is more likely to stimulate children's emotional states and has a better effect on learning programming.

10.1111/bjet.13412,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the collaborative dialogue patterns of pair programming and their impact on programming self‐efficacy and coding performance for both slow‐ and fast‐paced students. Forty‐six postgraduate students participated in the study. The students were asked to solve programming problems in pairs; those pairs' conversations were recorded when they worked on their tasks. Data analysis methods, including lag sequential analysis, cluster analysis and paired t‐test, were employed, and the results showed that (1) four collaborative dialogue patterns emerged: Lecture, Guide, Question and Answer (Q&A), and Inquiry patterns; (2) Guide and Inquiry patterns significantly increased programming self‐efficacy for both fast‐ and slow‐paced students while Lecture and Q&A patterns significantly increased programming self‐efficacy for slow‐paced students but not for fast‐paced students; (3) Guide and Inquiry patterns played a significant role in improving coding performance for slow‐paced students. The study reveals a complex relationship between collaborative dialogue patterns with programming self‐efficacy and coding performance, critically affecting students' pair programming quality. Further details of the findings are also discussed. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Pair programming is promising in promoting problem solving and knowledge transfer and is widely used in programming education.There are different patterns observed in the pair programming process.Collaborative dialogue patterns found in ""expert‐novice"" pair programming were derived from a single programming task.What this paper adds Four collaborative dialogue patterns of pair programming emerged by increasing the different tasks and experiment duration and expanding the sample size, which further verified the stability of the similar patterns in previous studies.Four collaborative dialogue patterns showed different significant impacts on different students' programming self‐efficacy and coding performance.This study presents the finer‐grained characteristics of collaborative interaction in programmer pairs and contributes to the explanation regarding the different effects of pair programming reported in previous studies.Implications for practice and/or policy Four collaborative dialogue patterns can help the teachers understand the collaborative process of pair programming between fast‐ and slow‐paced students.The collaborative dialogue patterns can be used to formulate effective intervention strategies to stimulate the process of collaboration in pairs and applied in future programming education to provide a new path for cultivating and promoting students' programming abilities.It is worth further investigating the impact of collaborative dialogue patterns on students' computational thinking.

It makes a need to have a flexible learning framework to develop all students to learn in a programming course. This study was designed to develop students’ learning achievement and computational thinking (CT) abilities by using a Design Thinking (DT)—Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) engineering design framework in a flipped web programming course. The participants were 41 students (males = 17, females = 24) coming from a Taiwan University. All of the students (20–21 years old) had e-learning-related backgrounds in a teacher’s college. The experiment was conducted for 14 weeks. The flipped learning and flipped DT-CDIO course each had a total teaching time of 6 weeks, and the midterm exam and final exam each took one week. We used a questionnaire and formative assessment to examine the students’ computational thinking ability and learning achievement before and after the course was applied. The results showed the students significantly improved their learning achievement and computational thinking ability. There were no significant gender differences in learning achievement. Some gender differences could be seen in some dimensions of CT ability. This study shows that the DT-CDIO framework brings many benefits to promote interdisciplinary learning by attracting STEAM talent and providing evidence to support the importance of flipped web programming courses.

While those features help novices begin programming with greater ease, questions arise about the overall utility of visual tools for app development. Analyses and comparisons of app development tools and technologies would make their advantages and disadvantages apparent, enabling instructional technologists to make informed decisions about tool selection. Toward that end, this work generated a new fram ework for comparing app development tools.

10.3390/fi12090152,"Due to its links to computer science (CS), teaching computational thinking (CT) often involves the handling of algorithms in activities, such as their implementation or analysis. Although there already exists a wide variety of different tasks for various learning environments in the area of computer science, there is less material available for CT. In this article, we propose so-called Generic Tasks for algorithms inspired by common programming tasks from CS education. Generic Tasks can be seen as a family of tasks with a common underlying structure, format, and aim, and can serve as best-practice examples. They thus bring many advantages, such as facilitating the process of creating new content and supporting asynchronous teaching formats. The Generic Tasks that we propose were evaluated by 14 experts in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Apart from a general estimation in regard to the meaningfulness of the proposed tasks, the experts also rated which and how strongly six core CT skills are addressed by the tasks. We conclude that, even though the experts consider the tasks to be meaningful, not all CT-related skills can be specifically addressed. It is thus important to define additional tasks for CT that are detached from algorithms and programming.

The study also sought to identify the effect of the qualification and years of experience variables on the degree to which the NGSS-aligned practices were present in the performance of physics teachers. The study adopted a mixed method in applying a closed-ended questionnaire and an interview. The questionnaire comprised 44 indicators and was applied to (49) teachers who were randomly selected. The interview was applied to (6) education supervisors who were purposively selected. The results revealed that the following five practices: ""asking questions and identifying problems""; ""obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information""; ""planning and carrying out investigations""; ""analyzing and interpreting data""; and ""involvement with proofs and evidence"" all rated medium. The three practices, ""interpretation and solutions design""; ""developing and using models""; and ""using mathematics and computational thinking"" all rated weak. Data analysis of education supervisors' interviews revealed that their opinions were, to an extent, concordant with the questionnaire findings. The results also revealed that graduate teachers exhibited a higher level of these practices than the teachers with just BS degrees while years of experience, as a variable, had no significant difference in teachers' use of these practices. It was concluded that teachers of physics need to reconsider their teaching practices to be aligned with NGSS. This study can be a contribution to teachers' professional development efforts that target the alignment of science instruction with the NGSS.

Currently, there are no age appropriate tools for teaching programming concepts and computational thinking to primary school children with visual disabilities. We address this gap through presenting the design and implementation of Torino, a tangible programming language for teaching programming concepts to children age 7–11 regardless of level of vision. In this paper, we: (1) describe the design process done in conjunction with children with visual disabilities; (2) articulate the design decisions made; and (3) report insights generated from an evaluation with 10 children with mixed visual abilities that considers how children are able to trace (read) and create (write) programs with Torino. We discuss key design trade-offs: (1) readability versus extensibility; and (2) size versus liveness. We conclude by reflecting upon how an inclusive design approach shaped the final result.

Determine where the children's books support an inclusive computing culture by representing people with diverse intersectional identities engaging in the computer science practices from the K-12 Computer Science Framework. We analyzed 45 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2019 targeted at K-8 students. We compiled evidence of the seven computer science practices and representation of diverse characters. Three or four practices appear in 64% of the books. The characters that engage in computing in the books are 56% female and 38% people of color. The books offer few examples of nonfictional people of color engaged in computer science, with no representation of adult males of color.

10.1080/08993408.2016.1160664,"Recent increased interest in computational thinking poses an important question to researchers: What are the best ways to teach fundamental computing concepts to students? Visualization is suggested as one way of supporting student learning. This mixed-method study aimed to (i) examine the effect of instruction in which students constructed visualizations on students’ programming achievement and students’ attitudes toward computer programming, and (ii) explore how this kind of instruction supports students’ learning according to their self-reported experiences in the course. The study was conducted with 58 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in their second programming class. They expect to teach information technology and computing-related courses at the primary and secondary levels. An embedded experimental model was utilized as a research design. Students in the experimental group were given instruction that required students to construct visualizations related to sorting, whereas students in the control group viewed pre-made visualizations. After the instructional intervention, eight students from each group were selected for semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the intervention based on visualization construction resulted in significantly better acquisition of sorting concepts. However, there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to students’ attitudes toward computer programming. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students in the experimental group constructed necessary abstractions through their engagement in visualization construction activities. The authors of this study argue that the students’ active engagement in the visualization construction activities explains only one side of students’ success. The other side can be explained through the instructional approach, constructionism in this case, used to design instruction. The conclusions and implications of this study can be used by researchers and instructors dealing with computational thinking.

,"The data collection procedure and process is one of the most critical components in a research study that affects the findings. Problems in data collection may directly influence the findings, and consequently, may lead to questionable inferences. Despite the challenges in data collection, this study provides insights for STEM education researchers and practitioners on effective data collection, in order to ensure that the data is useful for answering questions posed by research. Our engineering education research study was a part of a three-year, NSF funded project implemented in the Midwest region of the US. The project has engaged more than 60 teachers from 15 different public elementary schools and one private elementary school from five different school districts, as well as homeschool educators. More than 1,000 students, ages kindergarten to second grade, have been involved. Through this project, children engaged in integrated STEM + literacy +computational thinking activities in formal, informal, and homeschool settings. For this multi-faceted project, data collection was complex. The primary data collected for this project was video-recordings of K-2nd grade-aged children as they engaged in curriculum activities in both classroom and homeschool settings, as well as in activities designed for and set in a science center setting. Video recordings allow us to examine the ways that the children engage in engineering design and computational thinking, as well as in mathematics, science, and literacy. Video recordings also allow us to examine the interactions between children, as well as interactions between children and teachers/parents. Additional data included: copies of student work (e.g. worksheets, engineering design prototypes); field notes collected during classroom observation and science center visits; post-implementation interviews with teachers and parents; and surveys. In addition, a new approach, referred to as the 1+2 technique, in video data collection was developed to record the targeted data. Overall, the main aim of this paper is to provide critical insights for researchers who anticipate implementing more successful, purposeful and effective data collection in elementary schools, specifically in K-2 grade levels. We also anticipate that this paper will help practitioners and professional developers consider how they might collect video recordings: whether for allowing practitioners to reflect on their teaching practices; allowing teachers to share with families the in-class activities that children engage in; or assisting professional developers in developing video-based training materials.

10.1007/s11423-013-9327-0,"There are increasing calls to prepare K-12 students to use computational tools and principles when exploring scientific or mathematical phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how constructionist computer-supported collaborative environments can explicitly engage students in this practice. The Categorizer is a Javascript-based interactive gallery that allows members of a learning community to contribute computational artifacts they have constructed to a shared collection. Learners can then analyze the collection of artifacts, and sort them into user-defined categories. In a formative case study of the Categorizer for a fractal activity in three middle grade (ages 11-14) classrooms, there was evidence that participating students began to evaluate fractals based on structural and mathematical properties, and afterward could create algorithms that would generate fractals with particular area reduction rates. Further analysis revealed that students' construction and categorization experiences could be better integrated by explicitly scaffolding discussion and negotiation of the categorization schemes they develop. This led to the development of a new module that enables teachers and students to explore points of agreement and disagreement across student categorization schemes. I conclude with a description of limitations of the study and environment, implications for the broader community, and future work.

10.1080/10494820.2023.2207197,"In language learning, it is important to foster students’ computational thinking and improve their skills of building arguments and dialectical structure, teamwork, and decision accuracy. This is especially so in English language courses which aim to promote students’ cultural learning interest, creative thinking, and oral presentation. Collaborative argument mapping is an appropriate strategy to elicit those objectives. However, in the emergency distance learning (EDL) context, when online instruction lacks real-world learning and face-to-face interaction, it is challenging to teach units on cultural issues in authentic contexts. Therefore, in this study, the virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach was developed to address this problem. A quasi-experiment was designed with a total of 45 EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students. The experimental result showed that the virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach (VR-CAM) improved the students’ English oral presentation more than did the non-virtual reality-based collaborative argument mapping approach (non-VR-CAM). Although the VR-CAM group scored higher than the non-VR-CAM group on cultural learning interest, the two groups did not significantly differ. Furthermore, in the computational and creative thinking aspects, students who learned with VR-CAM performed significantly better than those who learned with non-VR-CAM over time.

,"Many information science (IS) training programs are gradually expanding their curricula to include computational data science courses such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. These programs focus on developing both classic information science competencies as well as core data science competencies among their students. Since data science competencies often associated with mathematical and computational thinking, departmental officials and prospective students often raise concerns regarding the appropriate background students should have in order to succeed in this newly introduced computational content of the program. In order to address these concerns, we report on an exploratory study through which we examined the 2020 student class of Bar-Ilan University's IS graduate training, focusing on the core computational data science courses (i.e., supervised and unsupervised machine learning). Our study shows that, to the contrary of many of the expressed concerns, students from the Humanities tend to score higher in data science competencies than those from the Social Sciences and better succeed in the training program as a whole. In addition, students' Bachelors' average grade acts as a good indicator for both their success in the training program and in the data science part thereof. In addition, we find no evidence to support concerns regarding age or sex. Finally, our study suggests that the computational data science part of students' training is very much aligned with the rest of their training program.

10.3390/sym14071405,"This paper proposes a symmetry language of block-based to design novel educational programming called the JLcoding system. JLcoding system helps students convert from a block-based language to a text-based programming language. The interface and function of the system are block-based programs such as Scratch, but it is designed with text-based architecture. The system contains graphic teaching to teach the basic knowledge of programming, such that students can maintain interest and confidence when learning computational thinking. The system simultaneously combines the advantages of block-based and text-based programming. This research engaged 41 students who learned block-based programming language as the research objects. The experimental results show that the students can obtain higher post-test scores than the pre-test scores after learning the JLcoding system. The degree of learning progress was not affected by their gender. Additionally, it was discovered that male students have higher confidence in their programming abilities, and students who have learning interests are more motivated to continue learning the program.

,"Computational thinking has become pervasive across many technical and creative disciplines. Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Your Voice is Power is a 5-class period curriculum targeted for K-12 audiences that seeks to promote racial equity and increase interest in computing careers by integrating elements of computing, music, social justice, and entrepreneurship. Centering around the song ""Entrepreneur"" by Pharrell Williams, students engage in lyrical analysis to extract and explore themes of social justice using the OUTKAST Imagination framework. Students then engage with musical concepts from a computing perspective and implement them using EarSketch, a web-based, learn-to-code through music remixing platform developed at Georgia Tech. In this paper, we present a description of the Your Voice is Power Curriculum and results from an evaluation study. The curriculum overview includes a description of the content and activities, as well as a discussion of the frameworks and theories underlying the curriculum's development. We also present results from a program evaluation covering both a pilot and a full implementation of this newly developed curriculum during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participating high school students and teachers were recruited to respond to online surveys regarding their awareness of and interest in computing, music, and social justice, and their experiences in the competition. Teachers felt that competition participation conferred a variety of benefits to their students and expressed positive attitudes around the social justice focus of the curriculum. Students provided largely positive feedback on the competition and reported a positive impact on their understanding of social justice and equity. Students also demonstrated high levels of understanding of the ubiquity of coding skills and applications. Taken together, program evaluation results show that this integration of themes is effective in engaging students in difficult conversations about race while building interest in computing.

,"Fluid mechanics laboratories traditionally use manual hydraulic instrumentation such as piezometers, venturi meters to make pressure and flow measurements and illustrate conservation of mass, energy and momentum. While these types of instruments continue to be used in the industry, there are also new sets of microprocessor-controlled instruments that are increasingly being utilized to make real time flow and energy measurements in real world systems. In addition to focusing on illustrating fundamental concepts related to flow, energy conservation, major and minor losses in pipes and open channels, it is also important to expose students to modern instrumentation methods that they will likely encounter in their practicing careers. Micro-processor based tools also help extend data collection outside traditional laboratory class times allowing students to work with high volume, high frequency (velocity) data. In addition, these processors can be programmed to collect data at different accuracies/precision thus enabling students to understand the veracity of measurements and associated uncertainties. Students also get a first-hand experience of various sensors and concepts related to physical computing (hardware/software integration) that is necessary in modern data collection endeavors. A sequence of micro-processor based sensors and web-based dashboards were introduced into the junior level mechanics of fluids laboratory making use of Arduinos, ESP8266s and Raspberry Pi environments. In particular, the Hall effect sensor for flow measurement, ultrasonic and laser based sensors for depth and hydraulic head measurements, temperature and salinity sensors were integrated to collect data in tandem with conventional hydraulic instruments and conservation principles. Students were exposed to the setup of the sensors and the associated software required to run the sensors. This allowed students to understand the role of indirect measurements (example voltage differences) and the role of calibration in obtaining hydraulic data. The ESP8266 allowed for integration of data with the cloud using ThingSpeak framework to demonstrate wireless sensing capabilities. The precision of measurements were controlled via programming and students were asked to evaluate which instrumentation provided greater precision in an effort to dispel the myth that automatic data acquisition does not necessarily imply accurate data collection. Informal and formal evaluation on the incorporation of micro-processor based sensors indicated students appreciated these additions to the laboratory as it provided them with exposure to modern data collection practices. In addition, the incorporation of these sensors partially overcame modifications to the civil engineering curriculum which resulted in removal of a course on introductory circuits. The use of Sensors and Online Dashboards in the lab also enabled downstreaming of the computational thinking concepts that students are being exposed to as part of a newly implemented common first year experience in the college of engineering.

,"We implemented a project to create transformative changes in the STEM Education at a Hispanic-serving institution by revamping mathematics curriculum and building a system of support in mathematics learning. The project accomplished three main areas of curriculum development: (1) Restructuring the first-year mathematics courses at the college algebra level using a corequisite model; (2) designing and implementing active learning and problem-solving oriented curriculum in Calculus; (3) building a student support system of peer-tutoring and mentoring through peer-led team learning. High impact strategies were used for increasing and sustaining the participation of women and underrepresented minority students in computing. Strategies included hands-on active and collaborative learning pedagogy, experiential learning with real world relevance and applications, and curriculum that incorporates data analysis, data visualization and computational thinking. The support targeted introductory courses to provide early exposure and engagement. This paper describes the curriculum restructuring and development, which led to the institutional implementation and transformation of mathematics curriculum. The paper also reports on the success of the redesigned courses.

Few K-12 programming environments are designed to teach debugging, and most debugging research were conducted on college-aged students. In this paper, we presented debugging exercises to 6th–8th grade students and analyzed their problem solving behaviors in a programming game – BOTS. Apart from the perspective of prior literature, we identified student behaviors in relation to problem solving stages, and correlated these behaviors with student prior programming experience and performance. We found that in our programming game, debugging required deeper understanding than writing new codes. We also found that problem solving behaviors were significantly correlated with students’ self-explanation quality, number of code edits, and prior programming experience. This study increased our understanding of younger students’ problem solving behavior, and provided actionable suggestions to the future design of debugging exercises in BOTS and similar environments.

The opacity of these applications, however, means that it is not clear how much they truly serve their users. A promising way to address the issue of possible undesired biases consists in giving users control by letting them configure a system and aligning its performance with users' own preferences. However, as the present paper argues, this form of control over an algorithmic system demands an algorithmic literacy that also entails a certain way of making oneself knowable: users must interrogate their own dispositions and see how these can be formalized such that they can be translated into the algorithmic system. This may, however, extend already existing practices through which people are monitored and probed and means that exerting such control requires users to direct a computational mode of thinking at themselves.

10.1007/s10649-023-10275-4,"Developing students' competence in algorithmic thinking is emerging as an objective of mathematics education, but despite its inclusion in mathematics curricula around the world, research into students' algorithmic thinking seems to be falling behind in this curriculum reform. The aim of this study was to investigate how the mathematical modelling process can be used as a vehicle for eliciting students' algorithmic thinking. To achieve this aim, a generative study was conducted using task-based interviews with year 12 students (n = 8) to examine how they used the mathematical modelling process to design an algorithm that solved a minimum spanning tree problem. I observed each students' modelling process and analysed how the task elicited the cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking. The findings showed that the students leveraged their mathematical modelling competencies to formulate a model of the problem using abstraction and decomposition, designed their algorithms by devising a fundamental operation to transform inputs into outputs during the working mathematically transition, and debugged their algorithms during the validating transition. Implications for practice are discussed.

10.1080/15710882.2023.2280582,"This paper summarises the co-design model utilised throughout 2020–2022 by WeatherBlur, a community-based citizen science project. Project leaders and teachers working in classrooms across multiple states collaborated to develop iterative instructional practices for classroom implementation and professional development to support teachers’ use of the program. Participants received necessary support and training to facilitate their ongoing success as the project evolved and grew. External evaluators tracked the planning group’s co-design process, collecting data on the research-practitioner partnership and the ways their input impacted the project’s development over time. During the final year of the project, the planning group reflected upon their work and identified five criteria that emerged as successful elements of this co-design process. 1. Creating a culture of trust, 2. Time and patience, 3. Foundational knowledge and deconstruction for understanding, 4. Mutually beneficial collaboration, and 5. Commitment to engagement and flexibility. We present a full explanation of these five criteria, including how the WeatherBlur team developed and nurtured the associated behaviours and strategies. This set of takeaways is applicable to many contexts, and this paper provides insight for future co-design models seeking to replicate a development process that utilises collective resources and input from a range of collaborators.

10.1080/10494820.2024.2308092,"Nursing students participating in labor support training need to learn core clinical skills to assess the delivery process to reduce the risk and labor pain of pregnant women. We proposed an approach to integrate scenario game-based learning with the experiential learning strategy to facilitate nursing students' learning performance and six core competencies (6CCs) (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, complex problem solving, creative thinking, and computational thinking) during labor support training. This study adopted a quasi-experimental study with a pretest and posttest design. We randomly allocated 44 first-year nursing students at a university nursing school to an experimental group (adopted scenario game-based learning integrated with the experiential learning strategy) (<italic>n</italic> = 21) or a control group (adopted video-based learning) (<italic>n</italic> = 23). Before and after the intervention, all students were assessed for their learning performance and 6CCs in labor support. The results showed that the experimental group exhibited significantly better learning performance and 6CCs than the control group, indicating that the integration of a scenario game-based learning with the experiential learning strategy validated a strong impact on nursing students' labor support training. Nurse scholars should deliberately incorporate appropriate technologies and learning strategies to facilitate nursing education.

Our findings show that the computational thinking practice of debugging is a rich source of opportunities to integrate these different disciplines. The analysis illustrates how the types of knowledge the students did and did not use at each step of the debugging process were related to their ability to succeed at each step. Our work contributes to theory and practice by uncovering implications for studying debugging through two refined frameworks and for designing debugging tasks to support transdisciplinary learning.

10.1080/07370008.2022.2157418,"The goal of this paper is to bring new insights to the study of social learning processes by designing measures of collaboration using high-frequency sensor data. More specifically, we are interested in understanding the interplay between moments of collaboration and cooperation, which is an understudied area of research. We collected a multimodal dataset during a collaborative learning activity typical of makerspaces: learning how to program a robot. Pairs of participants were introduced to computational thinking concepts using a block-based environment. Mobile eye-trackers, physiological wristbands, and motion sensors captured their behavior and social interactions. In this paper, we analyze the eye-tracking data to capture participants' tendency to synchronize their visual attention. This paper provides three contributions: (1) we use an emerging methodology (mobile dual eye-tracking) to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting and replicate findings that show how levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; (2) we qualitatively analyzed the co-occurrence of verbal activity and joint visual attention in low and high performing groups to better understand moments of collaboration and cooperation; (3) inspired by the qualitative observations and theories of collaborative learning, we designed a new quantitative measure that captures cycles of collaborative and cooperative work. Compared to simple measures of joint visual attention, we found it to increase correlation coefficients with learning and collaboration scores. We discuss those results and describe how advances in analyzing sensor data can contribute to theories of collaboration. We conclude with implications for capturing students' interactions in co-located spaces using Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA).

10.1007/s10956-019-09797-5,"This paper describes the work done by sixth grade students to achieve and sustain productive and personally meaningful lines of inquiry with computational models. The capacity to frame interactions with tools as dialogic exchanges with co-participants is a productive practice for disciplinary engagement in science and for computational thinking (Chandrasekharan and Nersessian 2015; Dennet 1989; Latour 1993; Pickering 1995). We propose that computational models have unique affordances for dialogic interaction because they are probabilistic and iteratively executable, features that provide an entry point for students to adopt stances that treat computational models as participants. Our analysis reveals that existing patterns in students' social interactions are resources for interacting flexibly with computational tools as participants. In particular, we found that students treated computational models as participants in three ways: (1) as conversational peers, (2) as co-constructors of lines of inquiry, and (3) as projections of students' agency and identity. Our data also demonstrate that students take on flexible, rather than fixed, stances toward computational participants. These stances parallel scientists' interactions with non-human entities, which often involve treating tools as agentive participants in inquiry (Latour 1999; Pickering 1995), affording students a pathway to practices at the intersection of disciplinary engagement and computational thinking.

10.1080/10494820.2019.1636087,"Recent scholarship in computer science (CS) education shifts from a focus on the technical-cognitive skills of computational thinking to the socio-cultural goal of computational participation, often illustrated as remixing popular media (e.g. music, photos, etc.) in online communities. These activities do enhance the participatory dimensions of CS, but whether they also support broadening the participation of underrepresented youth remains unclear. While online communities that are dedicated to computational participation have existed in the U.S. for over a decade, many communities of color remain underrepresented in CS disciplines. How might CS educators, researchers, and technologists promote culturally responsive forms of computational participation? To answer this question, we propose a culturally responsive framework for computational participation called generative computing. Generative computing approaches CS as a means for strengthening relationships between learning environments and local communities, leveraging culturally relevant sources of wealth generation in technology design and implementation. To explore this concept, we conducted a mixed-methods study with a cosmetology high school program that predominantly serves young African-American women. Through a series of computationally and culturally rich cosmetology projects, we tested our hypothesis that generative computing can enhance connections between Black heritage, CS, and cosmetology while supporting students' academic interests and knowledge.

10.3390/philosophies7030069,"Alan Turing's influence on subsequent research in artificial intelligence is undeniable. His proposed test for intelligence remains influential. In this paper, I propose to analyze his conception of intelligence by relying on traditional close reading and language technology. The Turing test is interpreted as an instance of conceptual engineering that rejects the role of the previous linguistic usage, but appeals to intuition pumps instead. Even though many conceive his proposal as a prime case of operationalism, it is more plausibly viewed as a stepping stone toward a future theoretical construal of intelligence in mechanical terms. To complete this picture, his own conceptual network is analyzed through the lens of distributional semantics over the corpus of his written work. As it turns out, Turing's conceptual engineering of the notion of intelligence is indeed quite similar to providing a precising definition with the aim of revising the usage of the concept. However, that is not its ultimate aim: Turing is after a rich theoretical understanding of thinking in mechanical, i.e., computational, terms.

10.1371/journal.pone.0265721,"From 2014 to 2017, the Islamic State in Irak and Syria (ISIS), a terrorist political organization of Salafist jihadist ideology, had put in place an operational and relatively stable educational system. Among its Complementary Programs, ISIS included a curriculum for programming using the Scratch software. In this article, we discuss this curriculum by analyzing the content of the official ISIS programming textbook, with the objectives of characterizing: 1) the curriculum's pedagogical intentions and definition of programming; 2) the programming curriculum; and 3) the religious and military indoctrination value. We found that, first, ISIS's programming curriculum intentions are more about religious and military injunctions to build the caliphate than they are about developing 21st-century skills such as computational thinking. Second, although the progression of learning in the sequence of activities designed by ISIS seems logical and, overall, well-ordered, the ISIS programming curriculum does not encourage the development of 21st-century skills such as problem solving, discovery learning, or creativity—nor for that matter, the transfer of programming knowledge to different contexts. Finally, the textbook is particularly rich in elements of military and religious indoctrination and effectively participates in the indoctrination of students by helping to inculcate values consistent with ISIS's jihadist ideology. This contribution seeks to better understand ISIS's approach to education, which could provide support for initiatives aimed at rebuilding impacted education systems and groups.

10.1016/j.learninstruc.2022.101667,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether a programming activity might serve as a learning vehicle for mathematics acquisition in grades four and five. For this purpose, the effects of a programming activity, an essential component of computational thinking, were evaluated on learning outcomes of three mathematical notions: Euclidean division (N = 1,880), additive decomposition (N = 1,763) and fractions (N = 644). Classes were randomly assigned to the programming (with Scratch) and control conditions. Multilevel analyses indicate negative effects (effect size range −0.16 to −0.21) of the programming condition for the three mathematical notions. A potential explanation of these results is the difficulties in the transfer of learning from programming to mathematics. • Compared to traditional activities, programming did not benefit mathematics learning. • A negative though small effect of programming on mathematics learning was found. • High-road transfer from programming to mathematics is not self-evident. • Visual programming languages might distract students from mathematics activities.

Students identified an environmental problem, executed a way to monitor it from the International Space Station (ISS) and interpreted the data received. Students' final report was awarded by ESA. Additionally, participants increased their performance in their math final exams compared to the control group. Furthermore, the perception of students and their families about the usefulness of mathematics was very positive. The only drawback detected was the increase of workload. Thus, Green STEM, using direct instruction and guide in PjBL, may be a good tool to improve students' grades and opinion about the importance of mathematics.

10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.003,"Several authors and studies highlight the benefits of the integration of Computer Science into K-12 education. Applications such as Scratch have been demonstrated to be effective in educational environments. The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.

10.1111/jcal.12495,"This study compares the effects of object‐oriented and robot programming activities on programming achievement, abstraction, problem solving, and motivation. In the study, two consecutive experimental cases were conducted to examine the consistency of findings. The research sample comprises 81 tenth‐grade students undergoing vocational secondary education. A total of 41 students participated in the first case that spanned 12 weeks, and 40 students participated in the second that spanned 8 weeks. After computational activities, the programming achievement scores significantly increased in all test groups. However, the achievement scores did not differ significantly between the groups. For the comparison groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the pre‐ and posttest scores of the formal and descriptive abstraction in both cases. However, a statistically significant increase was found in the formal (only Case 2) and descriptive abstraction scores of the students in the experimental groups. The abstraction results revealed a significant difference in the descriptive abstraction scores of Case 2 in favour of the experimental group. No statistically significant difference was found in the problem‐solving scores within or between groups. In both cases, the motivation scores of the experimental groups were found to be statistically higher than those of the comparison groups. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Programming activities that encourage how to think rather than what to think, have the potential to be effective instructional tools for cognitive processes.Despite the increasing research trend in computer science education, especially Computational Thinking (CT), there is a lack of studies investigating abstraction.Most of the studies on CT are based on a single cross‐sectional study shaped by relatively short‐term instructional activities and narrow‐scoped computational concepts. What this paper adds?: This study examined the effects of two programming modalities on tenth‐grade students' learning, intellectual skills, and motivation.Two consecutive interventions were conducted in order to examine the consistency of the findings.Robot programming is as effective as object‐oriented programming in the acquisition of programming concepts.Robot programming enhanced students' descriptive abstraction and motivation more effectively.Programming did not lead to any significant changes in students' problem‐solving approaches to daily‐life problems. Implications for practice and/or policy: The use of manipulative robotics can enrich learning outcomes in programming education.Robotic activities support the development of descriptive abstraction skills better than object‐oriented programming.Robotic technologies have great potential to increase student motivation regardless of the novelty effect.Problems used in programming activities should be chosen more relevant to the authentic world scenarios to connect computational approaches with daily life problems.Educational robots can be used as alternative tools to embody computational concepts in programming education.

,"Since the pandemic higher education has been in the process of rapid and fundamental change. Science educators seek to be more prepared to promote the inclusion of the ecological sciences into the curriculum of the biological sciences to prepare students to address 21st century problems (e.g., sea-level rise, loss of biodiversity). To achieve this goal, students need to learn how to think multidimensionally. This presentation introduces faculty to the Ecological Society of America's Four-dimensional Ecology Education (4DEE) Framework. The framework encompasses Ecological Concepts (EC), Ecological Practice (EP), Cross-Cutting Themes (CCT), and the Human-Environment Interaction (HEI) dimensions. Within each dimension are elements of ecological literacy (e.g., community ecology, species interactions). This presentation demonstrates how this framework was used to create a data-centered teaching module for undergraduate courses incorporating the 4DEE Framework. The data centered teaching module uses tree census data from two pre and post disturbance communities and has students compare successional trajectories after a decade of recovery. The module was designed engage students with elements in all four dimensions, EC (e.g., succession), EP (e.g., quantitative reasoning and computational thinking), HEI (e.g., ecosystem services), and CTC (e.g., spatial, and temporal scales). Faculty in attendance will gain an understanding of the 4DEE Framework and be able to consider how they can incorporate the 4DEE Framework into data or lessons that they currently have.

This article explores students' explanations in the context of computational science and engineering, an important interdisciplinary field that enables scientists and engineers to solve complex problems. Specifically, this study explores: (a) students' approaches to create written explanations of programing code and (b) the relationship between students' explanations and their ability to do computer programing. Students wrote in-code comments for 3 MATLAB® worked-examples, which were qualitatively analyzed using a coding scheme. Different approaches to self-explain were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis, and differences in students' ability to do computer programing were identified using analysis of variance. The resulting approaches to self-explain were: original solution, mechanistic, principle-based, limited, and goal-based. The findings suggest that experienced students wrote simple in-code comments to self-explain, but students with lower ability to do computer programing wrote more comprehensive explanations, as they may take this as a learning opportunity.

Titled “Foundations for Advancing Computational Thinking” (FACT), the course aims to prepare and motivate middle school learners for future engagement with algorithmic problem solving. FACT was also piloted as a seven-week course on Stanford’s OpenEdX MOOC platform for blended in-class learning. Unique aspects of FACT include balanced pedagogical designs that address the cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal aspects of “deeper learning”; a focus on pedagogical strategies for mediating and assessing for transfer from block-based to text-based programming; curricular materials for remedying misperceptions of computing; and “systems of assessments” (including formative and summative quizzes and tests, directed as well as open-ended programming assignments, and a transfer test) to get a comprehensive picture of students’ deeper computational learning. Empirical investigations, accomplished over two iterations of a design-based research effort with students (aged 11–14 years) in a public school, sought to examine student understanding of algorithmic constructs, and how well students transferred this learning from Scratch to text-based languages. Changes in student perceptions of computing as a discipline were measured. Results and mixed-method analyses revealed that students in both studies (1) achieved substantial learning gains in algorithmic thinking skills, (2) were able to transfer their learning from Scratch to a text-based programming context, and (3) achieved significant growth toward a more mature understanding of computing as a discipline. Factor analyses of prior computing experience, multivariate regression analyses, and qualitative analyses of student projects and artifact-based interviews were conducted to better understand the factors affecting learning outcomes. Prior computing experiences (as measured by a pretest) and math ability were found to be strong predictors of learning outcomes.

,"Data science is an interdisciplinary field that draws on the ideas and tools of many disciplines and varied professions. Data scientists may work as data analysts, or data engineers. We also can speak about vertical and horizontal data scientists. Data science education requires a richly layered system of relationships that are not just useful mechanisms, but also tools for navigating data as social text. Library and information science (LIS) overlaps significantly with data science, but data science is (at least for the time being) not standardised, because it often demands personalised, exploratory solutions. At the same time, data science offers new methods and practices for data librarianship that draw on the core values, ethics, skills and professional knowledge of general librarianship. Computational thinking, a common way of human problem solving, is one of the increasingly prominent competencies of data literacy that is an important part of both disciplines. The ideas that characterise our thinking about data science are linked not only to the cultivation of science, or commercial goals, but also to active and informed citizenship and action, which is also one of the reasons for the emergence of critical data literacy.

The aim of this study is to improve problem-solving skills (PSS), cognitive flexibility, meta-cognitive strategies use skills and spatial anxiety in teaching the 3D game development, supported with metacognitive strategies and restructured with SOLO. An embedded pattern is used in this study. This study showed that experimental intervention influences change in students' PSS and metacognitive strategies use skills. It is necessary to include SOLO taxonomy in content planning to increase the learning performance. It is supposed that the study results will provide an insight for implementers to design and execute difficult and complex teaching in computer science education and will assist them in developing different perspectives.

10.1111/jcal.12838,"Background: Several attitude scales have been developed to measure students' attitudes toward computer programming, including the prominent one developed by Cetin and Ozden. The development of these scales stemmed from the elusive nature of attitude and the lack of specific constructs to measure attitude. These instruments measure students' attitudes based on one‐dimensional perspective, thus, making it difficult to interpret the meaning of some attitude evaluations such as the meaning of neutral points in a 10‐point scale (for example). Objectives: The computer programming attitude scale was modified to measure ambivalence. The study also investigate attitude differences across demographic variables and used these variables to predict ambivalence. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the instrument was validated using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. In the second phase, the revised scale was administered to another 547 students in four research universities for empirical investigation. Results: Results show that the instrument is valid and suitable for measuring students' programming attitudes. Participants' attitudes skewed toward the negative attitude dimension. Lastly, we found that both attitude and ambivalence are factors of programming experience. Conclusions: We discussed the findings, recommend the instrument to programming tutors, and strongly emphasise the evaluation of students' ambivalent attitudes. Lay Description: What is currently known: There are numerous scales developed to measure students' attitude toward computer programming, such as the computer programming attitude scale (CPAS).The development of these inventories stemmed from the elusive nature of attitude and the lack of specific construct to measure attitude.These instruments measure students' attitude based on one dimensional perspective, thus, making it difficult to interpret the meaning of some attitude evaluations such as the meaning of neutral points in a 10‐point scale (for example). What this paper adds: The present research brings a novel approach to instrument development by acknowledging the presence of attitude toward computer programming.This novel approach advances the knowledge of instrument development in the field of attitude measurement by introducing a paradigm shift from conventional attitude evaluation to a more diverse approach.The study has introduced new items to the existing CPAS, and subsequently, indicates the possibility of validating an attitude inventory using data obtained from ambivalence evaluation.By using this instrument, students' attitude is measured accurately rather than adopting the conventional measures that ignored the presence of negative and positive evaluations. Implication to practitioners: Through the findings of the study, computer science and programming educators would come to know that many positive and negative attitude elements are occasionally subsumed toward an attitude object, thereby leading to an ambivalence attitude.The instrument can be used by the practitioners to accurately measure students' positive and negative attitude toward programming across all levels of education.Using the instrument, practitioners can predict the identified attitude using wide range of variables such as gender, age, computational thinking skills, programming proficiency levels, among others.

10.3138/jelis-2021-0076,"Many Library and Information Science (LIS) training programs are gradually expanding their curricula to include computational data science courses such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. These programs focus on developing both ""classic"" information science competencies as well as core data science competencies among their students. Since data science competencies are often associated with mathematical and computational thinking, departmental officials and prospective students often raise concerns regarding the appropriate background students should have in order to succeed in this newly introduced computational content of the LIS training programs. In order to address these concerns, we report on an exploratory study through which we examined the 2020 and 2021 student classes of Bar-Ilan University's LIS graduate training, focusing on the computational data science courses (i.e., supervised and unsupervised machine learning). Our study shows that contrary to many of the concerns raised, students from the humanities performed as well (and in some cases significantly better) on data science competencies compared to those from the social sciences and had better success in the training program as a whole. In addition, students' undergraduate GPA acted as an adequate indicator for both their success in the training program and in the data science part thereof. In addition, we find no evidence to support concerns regarding age or sex. Finally, our study suggests that the computational data science part of students' training is very much aligned with the rest of their training program.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104287,"Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors. • This study develops a DT-CDIO method for a flipped programming course. • The flow experience is determined based on computational thinking ability and cognitive load. • The relationship between the flow experience and both cognitive load and computational thinking skills is investigated. • The flow experience is found to have a negative impact on creativity and problem solving. • Teachers can apply specific teaching methods that will improve computational thinking skills.

10.3390/s21031006,"Over the last years, mobile robot platforms are having a key role in education worldwide. Among others, LEGO Robots and MATLAB/Simulink are being used mainly in universities to improve the teaching experience. Most LEGO systems used in the literature are based on NXT, as the EV3 version is relatively recent. In contrast to the previous versions, the EV3 allows the development of real-time applications for teaching a wide variety of subjects as well as conducting research experiments. The goal of the research presented in this paper was to develop and validate a novel real-time educational platform based on the MATLAB/Simulink package and the LEGO EV3 brick for academic use in the fields of robotics and computer science. The proposed framework is tested here in different university teaching situations and several case studies are presented in the form of interactive projects developed by students. Without loss of generality, the platform is used for testing different robot path planning algorithms. Classical algorithms like rapidly-exploring random trees or artificial potential fields, developed by robotics researchers, are tested by bachelor students, since the code is freely available on the Internet. Furthermore, recent path planning algorithms developed by the authors are also tested in the platform with the aim of detecting the limits of its applicability. The restrictions and advantages of the proposed platform are discussed in order to enlighten future educational applications.

10.1155/2021/3846078,"The booming computational thinking and deep learning make it possible to construct agile, efficient, and robust deep learning-driven decision-making support engine for the operation of container terminal handling systems (CTHSs). Within the conceptual framework of computational logistics, an attention mechanism oriented hybrid convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network deep learning architecture (AMO-HCR-DLA) is proposed technically to predict the container terminal liner handling conditions that mainly include liner handling time (LHT) and total working time of quay crane farm (TWT-QCF) for a calling liner. Consequently, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computation (CTO-LGC) automation and intelligence are established tentatively by AMO-HCR-DLA. A typical regional container terminal hub of China is selected to design, implement, execute, and evaluate the AMO-HCR-DLA with the actual production data. In the case of severe vibration of LHT and TWT-QCF, while forecasting the handling conditions of 210 ships based on the CTO-LGC running log of four years, the forecasting error of LHT within one hour is more than 97% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours accounts for 89.405%. When predicting the operating conditions of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting deviation of LHT within one hour is more than striking 99% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours reaches up to 94.010% as well. All are far superior to the predicting outcomes by the classical algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. Hence, the AMO-HCR-DLA shows excellent performance for the prediction of CTHS with the low and stable computational consuming. It also demonstrates the feasibility, credibility, and realizability of the computing architecture and design paradigm of AMO-HCR-DLA preliminarily.

10.1007/s10956-013-9437-9,"The goal of the present study was to utilize a profiling approach to understand differences in motivation and strategic self-regulation among post-secondary STEM students in major versus required non-major computer science courses. Participants were 233 students from required introductory computer science courses (194 men; 35 women; 4 unknown) at a large Midwestern state university. Cluster analysis identified five profiles: (1) a strategic profile of a highly motivated by-any-means good strategy user; (2) a knowledge-building profile of an intrinsically motivated autonomous, mastery-oriented student; (3) a surface learning profile of a utility motivated minimally engaged student; (4) an apathetic profile of an amotivational disengaged student; and (5) a learned helpless profile of a motivated but unable to effectively self-regulate student. Among CS majors and students in courses in their major field, the strategic and knowledge-building profiles were the most prevalent. Among non-CS majors and students in required non-major courses, the learned helpless, surface learning, and apathetic profiles were the most prevalent. Students in the strategic and knowledge-building profiles had significantly higher retention of computational thinking knowledge than students in other profiles. Students in the apathetic and surface learning profiles saw little instrumentality of the course for their future academic and career objectives. Findings show that students in STEM fields taking required computer science courses exhibit the same constellation of motivated strategic self-regulation profiles found in other post-secondary and K-12 settings.

,"Modernization of the educational content in the field of Computer science, or IT subjects, in the conditions of Czech primary schools is a relatively widely discussed topic today, as the educational content as well as the teaching methods of IT subjects at primary schools often remain more or less unchanged for many years. However, a completely different situation can be observed abroad, where, for many years, prominent experts have been making proposals to change the concept of teaching so that pupils are not only educated to become active technology users, but are also encouraged to try to devise their own procedures, propose tools for solving specific problems and develop the so-called computational thinking. So, what does the specific educational content of IT subjects at the 1st and 2nd stage of Czech primary schools look like? Which IT topics are actually taught? Are there any topics in teaching that are not embedded or accentuated in the curriculum documents? We will try to answer these questions in the submitted paper, which presents some partial outputs of the conducted research focused primarily on the issue of the acceptance of educational content of IT subjects taught at primary schools.

10.1111/bjet.13080,"Natural language helps express mathematical thinking and contexts. Conventional mathematical notation (CMN) best suits expressions and equations. Each is essential; each also has limitations, especially for learners. Our research studies how programming can be a advantageous third language that can also help restore mathematical connections that are hidden by topic‐centred curricula. Restoring opportunities for surprise and delight reclaims mathematics' creative nature. Studies of children's use of language in mathematics and their programming behaviours guide our iterative design/redesign of mathematical microworlds in which students, ages 7–11, use programming in their regular school lessons as a language for learning mathematics. Though driven by mathematics, not coding, the microworlds develop the programming over time so that it continues to support children's developing mathematical ideas. This paper briefly describes microworlds EDC has tested with well over 400 7‐to‐8‐year‐olds in school, and others tested (or about to be tested) with over 200 8‐to‐11‐year‐olds. Our challenge was to satisfy schools' topical orientation and fit easily within regular classroom study but use and foreshadow other mathematical learning to remove the siloes. The design/redesign research and evaluation is exploratory, without formal methodology. We are also more formally studying effects on children's learning. That ongoing study is not reported here. Practitioner notesWhat is already known Active learning—doing—supports learning.Collaborative learning—doing together—supports learning.Classroom discourse—focused, relevant discussion, not just listening—supports learning.Clear articulation of one's thinking, even just to oneself, helps develop that thinking.What this paper adds The common languages we use for classroom mathematics—natural language for conveying the meaning and context of mathematical situations and for explaining our reasoning; and the formal (written) language of conventional mathematical notation, the symbols we use in mathematical expressions and equations—are both essential but each presents hurdles that necessitate the other. Yet, even together, they are insufficient especially for young learners.Programming, appropriately designed and used, can be the third language that both reduces barriers and provides the missing expressive and creative capabilities children need.Appropriate design for use in regular mathematics classrooms requires making key mathematical content obvious, strong and the 'driver' of the activities, and requires reducing tech 'overhead' to near zero.Continued usefulness across the grades requires developing children's sophistication and knowledge with the language; the powerful ways that children rapidly acquire facility with (natural) language provides guidance for ways they can learn a formal language as well.Implications for policy and/or practice Mathematics teaching can take advantage of the ways children learn through experimentation and attention to the results, and of the ways children use their language brain even for mathematics.In particular, programming—in microworlds driven by the mathematical content, designed to minimise distraction and overhead, open to exploration and discovery en route to focused aims, and in which children self‐evaluate—can allow clear articulation of thought, experimentation with immediate feedback.As it aids the mathematics, it also builds computational thinking and satisfies schools' increasing concerns to broaden access to ideas of computer science.

10.1111/bjet.13078,"Constructionism has different meanings for what the learner is constructing, a concrete object or an idea, and whether this construction is done through the use of digital technology. In the embodied‐based environment created in this study, children carry out or ""construct"" a series of actions, a performance, which allows them to solve the task of directing an already programmed robot to a particular target. The activity was based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood narrative. Children played the role of rangers (instead of hunters) who had to coordinate their actions in order to help a robot (an mBot characterized as a Robot‐Wolf) find Grandma's laboratory, so she could fix its GPS. The children wore boots, which were used to interact with the Robot‐Wolf. The main question we addressed was how to create this embodied‐based environment for kindergarten children, and how to identify the actions children performed and the concepts they used in this construction. The research was based on the Socially‐Aware Design, and the study was conducted in a school setting for kindergarten students. 26 children (11F, 15 M), between 4 and 5 years old, participated in this study. The children's activities were recorded and analysed using the Grounded Theory methodology. The results show that the children's performative sequence of actions is distinct from the hands‐on, heads‐in processes that are part of classical constructionist environments. For the children, the process and the product of their (body) ""dance"" were underlying their movement (perceiving and acting), working together so as to accomplish the given task in the environment. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Constructionism has shown as a way for learning via materialization of tangible objects or construction of ideas.There are very few examples of constructionist learning environments for kindergarten children to interact with digital technology.What this paper adds The creation of the constructionist embodied‐based environment for supporting kindergarten children interacting with digital technologies.The constructionist embodied‐based environment created was effective in supporting kindergarten children interacting with an already programmed robot.Children's performative sequence of actions reveals no separation of the hands‐on, heads‐in processes as in classical constructionist environments.The creation of a constructionist environment in which children can act and collaborate to construct a series of actions which allow them to solve a specific challenge.Implications for practice and/or policy Concepts like leadership and anticipation which were embodied are expressed by the children help to understand how the robot‐based activity can help children to construct knowledge related to, for example, computational thinking.

10.2478/jdis-2021-0001,"Digital literacy and related fields have received interests from scholars and practitioners for more than 20 years; nonetheless, academic communities need to systematically review how the fields have developed. This study aims to investigate the research trends of digital literacy and related concepts since the year of 2000, especially in education. The current study analyzes keywords, co-authorship, and cited publications in digital literacy through the scientometric method. The journal articles have been retrieved from the WoS (Web of Science) using four keywords: ""Digital literacy,"" ""ICT literacy,"" ""information literacy,"" and ""media literacy."" Further, keywords, publications, and co-authorship are examined and further classified into clusters for more in-depth investigation. Digital literacy is a multidisciplinary field that widely embraces literacy, ICT, the Internet, computer skill proficiency, science, nursing, health, and language education. The participants, or study subjects, in digital literacy research range from primary students to professionals, and the co-authorship clusters are distinctive by countries in America and Europe. This paper analyzes one fixed chunk of a dataset obtained by searching for all four keywords at once. Further studies will retrieve the data from diverse disciplines and will trace the change of the leading research themes by time spans. To shed light on the findings, using customized digital literacy curriculums and technology is critical for learners at different ages to nurture digital literacy according to their learning aims. They need to cultivate their understanding of the social impact of exploiting technology and computational thinking. To increase the originality of digital literacy-related studies, researchers from different countries and cultures may collaborate to investigate a broader range of digital literacy environments. The present study reviews research trends in digital literacy and related areas by performing a scientometric study to analyze multidimensional aspects in the fields, including keywords, journal titles, co-authorship, and cited publications.

10.1007/s10798-019-09560-2,"Leading architectural firms in professional practice are expanding their range of design possibilities using digital design strategies. A digital design strategy enables architects to make informed decisions and better handle the interdisciplinary nature of the discipline, while dealing with various complexities, uncertainties and an infinite number of the potential solutions. One of the main responsibilities of architectural education is to educate students on the breadth of professional opportunities and career paths. Therefore, it is highly important to examine the sufficiency of available digital design courses in the architectural education curriculum. To achieve this, the study examines the curriculum of two architectural programs in the Middle East and compares the findings with award-winning architectural firms in international professional practice from a digital design perspective. In the first step, various cutting-edge technology-driven firms were investigated, then three award-winning firms were subsequently selected and studied using a deliberate review. Secondly, the curriculum of each architecture school was reviewed and the responsible instructors were interviewed through a qualitative method of in-depth interviews; the perceptions and suggestions of eight academic staff members from both schools (four each) were recorded to facilitate an assessment of the status of the integrated digital design methodologies in the architecture education of the intended schools. The findings indicate that the current structures of architecture education curricula cannot match the innovative challenges and social demands of architecture in the digital age. The importance of curriculum review, as well as different incorporation alternatives of the digital design applications, are also suggested.

10.1007/s10956-017-9726-9,"Computational tools and methods have permeated multiple science and engineering disciplines, because they enable scientists and engineers to process large amounts of data, represent abstract phenomena, and to model and simulate complex concepts. In order to prepare future engineers with the ability to use computational tools in the context of their disciplines, some universities have started to integrate these tools within core courses. This paper evaluates the effect of introducing three computational modules within a thermodynamics course on student disciplinary learning and self-beliefs about computation. The results suggest that using worked examples paired to computer simulations to implement these modules have a positive effect on (1) student disciplinary learning, (2) student perceived ability to do scientific computing, and (3) student perceived ability to do computer programming. These effects were identified regardless of the students’ prior experiences with computer programming.

10.1111/jcal.12219,"Abstract: Educational robotics programs offer an engaging opportunity to potentially teach core computer science concepts and practices in K–12 classrooms. Here, we test the effects of units with different programming content within a virtual robotics context on both learning gains and motivational changes in middle school (6th–8th grade) robotics classrooms. Significant learning gains were found overall, particularly for groups introduced to content involving program flow, the structural logic of program execution. Relative gains for these groups were particularly high on items that require the transfer of knowledge to dissimilar contexts. Reaching units that included program flow content was also associated with greater maintenance of programming interest when compared with other units. Therefore, our results suggest that explicit instruction in the structural logic of programming may develop deeper transferrable programming knowledge and prevent declines in some motivational factors.

10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.029,"Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle . LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.

10.1177/0042098016664305,"As visions of smart urbanism gain traction around the world, it is crucial that we question the benefits that an increasingly technologised urbanity promise. It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples' lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of Singapore's Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home and 'learning to code' movement, I highlight the limits of such 'smart' interventions as they are stunted by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better peoples' everyday lives, technological 'solutionism' needs to be replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban challenges.

10.1080/10494820.2019.1612446,"Portfolios have recently gained traction within computer science education as a way to assess students' computational thinking and practices. Whereas traditional assessments such as exams tend to capture learning within artificial settings at a single point in time, portfolios provide more authentic opportunities to document a trajectory of students' learning and practices in everyday contexts. Furthermore, because communication itself has been defined as an important computational thinking practice, portfolios give students a place to practice this skill in the classroom. In this study, we report on the implementation of a digital portfolio with a class of 21 high school students used to capture the process of creating of an electronic textile mural project. While students' understanding of computational concepts were only partially captured within the portfolios, their engagements with computational practices – such as debugging and iteration – were better highlighted. Much of this was due to the students' existing communicative strategies themselves, both in terms of how precise they were in describing issues, as well as how they leveraged images and code to explain their process. Recommendations for designing more effective portfolio assessments are discussed, which include greater emphasis on creating shared classroom discourse, and leveraging students' existing experiences with multimedia.

,"This paper presents cMinds, a learning intervention that deploys game-based visual programming towards building analytical, computational, and critical thinking skills in primary education. The proposed learning method exploits the structured nature of programming, which is inherently logical and transcends cultural barriers, towards inclusive learning that exposes learners to algorithmic thinking. A visual programming environment, entitled 'cMinds Learning Suite', has been developed aimed for classroom use. Feedback from the deployment of the learning methods and tools in classrooms in several European countries demonstrates elevated learner motivation for engaging in logical learning activities, fostering of creativity and an entrepreneurial spirit, and promotion of problem-solving capacity.

10.1007/s10956-023-10049-w,"Interpreting and creating computational systems models is an important goal of science education. One aspect of computational systems modeling that is supported by modeling, systems thinking, and computational thinking literature is ""testing, evaluating, and debugging models."" Through testing and debugging, students can identify aspects of their models that either do not match external data or conflict with their conceptual understandings of a phenomenon. This disconnect encourages students to make model revisions, which in turn deepens their conceptual understanding of a phenomenon. Given that many students find testing and debugging challenging, we set out to investigate the various testing and debugging behaviors and behavioral patterns that students use when building and revising computational system models in a supportive learning environment. We designed and implemented a 6-week unit where students constructed and revised a computational systems model of evaporative cooling using SageModeler software. Our results suggest that despite being in a common classroom, the three groups of students in this study all utilized different testing and debugging behavioral patterns. Group 1 focused on using external peer feedback to identify flaws in their model, group 2 used verbal and written discourse to critique their model's structure and suggest structural changes, and group 3 relied on systemic analysis of model output to drive model revisions. These results suggest that multiple aspects of the learning environment are necessary to enable students to take these different approaches to testing and debugging.

10.1016/j.tics.2023.04.004,"Creativity involves associative thinking: linking concepts from memory. Computational models of semantic memory allow researchers to quantify associative thinking as movement through a semantic space of concepts. Associative thinking reflects a search process operating on a semantic memory network structure. Highly creative people travel further in semantic space, switch between more semantic subcategories, and make larger leaps between associations. Creativity involves both free associations, in which concepts are spontaneously connected, and goal-directed associations, in which concepts are strategically combined. Free association is relevant for artistic creativity, implicating domain-general cognitive abilities in domain-specific creative expertise. Neuroscience evidence indicates associative thinking engages brain regions involved in both semantic and episodic memory. Creativity has long been thought to involve associative processes in memory: connecting concepts to form ideas, inventions, and artworks. However, associative thinking has been difficult to study due to limitations in modeling memory structure and retrieval processes. Recent advances in computational models of semantic memory allow researchers to examine how people navigate a semantic space of concepts when forming associations, revealing key search strategies associated with creativity. Here, we synthesize cognitive, computational, and neuroscience research on creativity and associative thinking. This Review highlights distinctions between free- and goal-directed association, illustrates the role of associative thinking in the arts, and links associative thinking to brain systems supporting both semantic and episodic memory – offering a new perspective on a longstanding creativity theory.

This article describes the curriculum entitled Fundamental Computing, an implementation of curriculum and textbooks for the second stage of Brazilian Primary Education. The curriculum is based on spiral curriculum, meaningful learning, constructionist projects and contextualizing learning of computing. The associated textbooks offer a guide for teachers and activities for students that allow them to learn basic elements of computing and carry out practices of computing and reflections from practice. The first experiences with the curriculum point to implementation challenges in terms of infrastructure, teacher professional development and integration with existing school curricula. On the other hand, they also reveal potential positive effects in its adoption in terms of creative expression, interdisciplinary learning, student motivation and engagement, and knowledge retention.

10.1007/s10021-008-9136-1,"Computational thinking (CT) is a way to solve problems and understand complex systems that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science and is well suited to the challenges that face researchers of complex, linked social-ecological systems. This paper explores CT’s usefulness to sustainability science through the application of the services-oriented architecture (SOA). The SOA is a popular organizational framework in information technology that enables businesses to describe the services they offer, including how, where, to whom, and under what terms these services are available to consumers. It provides a straightforward, scalable, and portable way to describe and organize complex business systems, with an emphasis on system controls and component interactions rather than on the system components themselves. Here, we present the SOA as a path to a more mature ecosystem services concept, in support of integrated assessment frameworks such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). With the SOA we capture important interrelationships among ecosystems, ecosystem service consumers, and ecosystem service governance authorities, particularly the effects of their interactions on the viability of ecosystem services. By standardizing the description and relationships involving ecosystem services, the SOA supports a diagnostic approach for evaluating stability and change in ecosystem service use across both space and time, when influenced by drivers of social, political, and/or ecological change, whether directional or stochastic, planned or otherwise. We present here a prototype of the SOA and illustrate its utility with an example from rural Alaskan communities.

Individuals with high programming experience might develop a form of computational thinking, which they can apply on complex problem-solving tasks such as reasoning tests. Therefore, N = 20 healthy young participants with previous programming experience and N = 21 participants without any programming experience performed three reasoning tests: Figural Inductive Reasoning (FIR), Numerical Inductive Reasoning (NIR), Verbal Deductive Reasoning (VDR). Using multi-channel EEG measurements, task-related changes in alpha and theta power as well as brain connectivity were investigated. Group differences were only observed in the FIR task. Programmers showed an improved performance in the FIR task as compared to non-programmers. Additionally, programmers exhibited a more efficient neural processing when solving FIR tasks, as indicated by lower brain activation and brain connectivity especially in easy tasks. Hence, behavioral and neural measures differed between groups only in tasks that are similar to mental processes required during programming, such as pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking by applying complex rules (FIR), rather than in tasks that require more the application of mathematical operations (NIR) or verbal tasks (VDR).

10.1007/s10643-019-00976-y,"Modern preschool education is seen as an essential foundation for nurturing children's digital literacy. Early childhood education environments have witnessed increased emphasis on integrating programming activities in combination with digital tablets. However, little is known about how preschool teachers implement programming as part of pedagogical strategies during practice. In Sweden, although there is a mandate to develop children's understanding of the digital world, programming is not formally mentioned in the revised preschool curriculum. This study systematically investigates how Swedish preschool teachers implement programming activities in their teaching practice. Data was collected through a national online survey (n = 199). Findings revealed a range of apps and resources used in combination with tablets, where activity integration takes place as unplugged programming, digital programming, or as a combination of the former. Teachers markedly attributed intended learning goals around programming to tenets of computational thinking and ""twenty-first century skills"". Moreover, programming was often actively linked to learning in other domains such as science, technology, mathematics, and language, approaches that show traditional Swedish preschool teaching practices being recontextualized in terms of programming. Based on the reported findings that provide insight into the implementation of programming in preschools, a logical future research avenue lies in exploring the documented programming activities from the perspective of the children.

10.1007/s00422-020-00830-0,"Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179–193, 2018. 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and ""hybrid cells"" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.

10.1080/15710882.2020.1722173,"We propose computational empowerment as an approach and a Participatory Design (PD) response to challenges related to the emerging need for digital literacy in lower secondary education. Our approach extends the current focus on computational thinking to include a concern for how children and youth are empowered through constructive, analytical and critical engagement with technology. We argue that PD has the potential to drive a computational empowerment agenda in education by connecting political PD with contemporary visions for addressing a future digitised labour market and society. We provide a model for understanding and engaging with computational empowerment and report on the emergence of the computational empowerment agenda in a Danish context and how this agenda is reflected in the newly developed curriculum for a course on technology comprehension running on trial basis in 46 schools across Denmark.

,"Course-based undergraduate research (CURE) is an educational paradigm to engage students in authentic research projects as part of their classroom experience. We present a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for first-year students to get acquainted with the research process and apply the skills of scientific computing to investigate publicly available information on climate change and its impacts. The course trains students in elementary programming skills and computational thinking using the Wolfram language (WL) and the Mathematica platform. The experience also provides students with an introduction to the climate change studies, secondary literature, and policy recommendations provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Students apply the programming, data analysis, and information literacy skills from the course to identify and investigate climate change data to improve their research skills and engage with their peers in a collaborative research experience. The results of our pedagogical experiment are presented in the form of student survey results from the national CURE survey. We highlight student responses toward this learning experience and showcase the positive outcomes compared to results from the nationwide CURE survey of students.

,"Computational thinking or CT refers to the thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer. CT is not merely using software or computer programs alone but is also interlinked with information and communication technology (ICT) and computer science based on problems; tools; action (praxis); solutions; concepts; and social needs. Hence, the aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of using scratch program to teach Malay language subject. As part of the methodology, 32, 4th year students in a primary school of Seremban district participated in the study. A case study was used. The teachers teach Malay language subject using scratch programs with the theme of agriculture and title of food product from agriculture. The students were to arrange the basic words into grammatical sentences based on the scratch program and write a cake recipe using an algorithmic technique, a series of instructions contained in the scratch program. This conceptual teaching and learning algorithm was conducted in five steps namely the induction set; step 1; step 2; step 3; and enrichment and recovery. The result of this study shows that students could understand the concepts of algorithms taught and did not require recovery activities. This implies that the algorithm concept of how to prepare a cake through a scratch program has been fully understood by the students. Students are also excited about the algorithmic techniques and the scratch program generated. As a conclusion, the student's reaction as they remain focused throughout the session shows that the use of algorithms and scratch programs is better than conventional methods in teaching the Malay Language.

,"Research identifies a national urgency to improve teacher performance and student achievement in science and engineering. This paper responds to this need and presents the results of nine years of Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs funded by the National Science Foundation, in which engineering faculty collaborate with middle and high school teachers and their students. One program (4 years) is a comprehensive teacher professional development program in which middle school teachers participate in an intensive summer research experience in computer science and engineering labs, build curriculum based on the laboratory research content that they learn, participate in lesson study, and implement new curriculum in their middle classrooms. The second program (5 years) is a high school teacher RET program with similar components. This paper contains a combined report of results of both of the RET programs. The two programs had the combined intent of bringing innovative computer science and engineering research to middle and high school teachers and their students and improving teacher performance, while simultaneously improving student achievement through scientific inquiry, engaging students in computational thinking, and engineering design. The programs' design included a summer intensive experience in which teachers fully participated in a computer science or engineering laboratory research and engaged in an inquiry focused content-to-pedagogy teacher professional development workshop, building curriculum from their lab research experience with foci on scientific experimentation and improving students' STEM achievement and content area literacy. The programs were both aligned with Common Core Math Standards and Next Generation Science Standards and addressed the research question: What is the impact of an intensive researchbased teacher professional development program on both teacher and student performance? In total, eighty-seven teachers and their 12,436 students participated in the two RET programs combined. Assessment measures used to determine the impact of the two RET programs were: a teacher instructional performance measure, the Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrumentrevised, a STEM content area qualitative reading inventory, grade and content specific concept inventories, and a student motivation for science questionnaire. The combined program results were the highly impactful. The RET teachers had a mean science teaching efficacy significantly higher than the national average. The mean score on teacher performance measure was also significantly higher than the state's average rating. The RET teachers also had a significant performance gain pre-to-post program. Student related results indicated gains as well. Specifically, the participating teachers' students made significant gains during their curricular intervention resulting from their teachers' participation in the RET programs. The students gained computer science and engineering knowledge, increased their science interest and motivation, and demonstrated gains in STEM literacy as well. These results indicate that research experience for teachers programs benefit both the teachers and the students that they teach.

,"This paper will share initial findings from the first year of a Research Experience for Teachers site, supporting nine secondary STEM teachers from diverse schools in six-week university research projects in socially impactful Big Data and Data Science. We have examined the perspectives on learning of three key site groups: the computer scientist principal investigator, the secondary STEM teachers participating in the RET, and the graduate research assistants who mentored the teachers in original research projects. Teachers also translated their research experience into curriculum incorporating the engineering practice of mathematical and computational thinking and described the lessons they learned from the research process through focus group interviews, seminar presentations, and lesson plans. Preliminary findings suggest each of the site groups saw their own work and their role in that work, from a different perspective. Members of each group found themselves in the role of a novice in another field and enjoyed the challenge that being a novice represented.

,"Providing real-time feedback to novice programmers is critical to their ability to learn to program. Higher enrollment in introductory computer science courses reduces the amount of time for individual student-instructor interaction. Reduced interaction time equates to a reduction in the time for and amount of instructor feedback. Building on our work involving manual classification and analysis of student source code comments, in this full paper we explore how machine learning techniques can be leveraged to provide automated feedback to students with regards to their computational thinking processes. This paper discusses the initial classification of student source code comments using supervised machine learning methods. In this phase of classification, we focus on whether a comment is sufficient or insufficient. The classification process is broken down into three steps: text processing, data exploration, and comment classification using the Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier. We detail the text processing requirements, including how to prepare the raw student data using natural languages processing techniques such as stop word filtration, tokenization, and lemmatization. We also show how the data preparation process can affect the final classification outcome. Using Multinomial Naïve Bayes we achieved a precision rate of 82%. Using a Random Forest classifier and lemmatization we achieved a classification precision of 90%. We conclude with a description of how the current classification results can be used to provide real-time feedback to students while they are learning to program. Towards our ultimate goal of providing comprehensive real-time feedback to students, we describe future research plans, which include using unsupervised machine learning techniques to move beyond basic binary classification.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103807,"Computational thinking (CT) and the coding element of it are progressively entering in the primary school curriculum worldwide. Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum. • Eight hours practice with Code.org are sufficient to support the development of coding skills in 6-year old children. • Gains in coding skills are transferred to children's executive functions: planning and response inhibition. • Transfer of coding effects is more evident for planning than for response inhibition. • The use of different cognitive tasks to assess the degree of cognitive transfer is important.

10.1080/08993408.2016.1231784,"This paper describes the development, validation, and uses of the Collaborative Computing Observation Instrument (C-COI), a web-based analysis instrument that classifies individual and/or collaborative behaviors of students during computing problem-solving (e.g. coding, programming). The C-COI analyzes data gathered through video and audio screen recording software that captures students’ computer screens as they program, and their conversations with their peers or adults. The instrument allows researchers to organize and quantify these data to track behavioral patterns that could be further analyzed for deeper understanding of persistence and/or collaborative interactions. The article provides a rationale for the C-COI including the development of a theoretical framework for measuring collaborative interactions in computer-mediated environments. This theoretical framework relied on the computer-supported collaborative learning literature related to adaptive help seeking, the joint problem-solving space in which collaborative computing occurs, and conversations related to outcomes and products of computational activities. Instrument development and validation also included ongoing advisory board feedback from experts in computer science, collaborative learning, and K-12 computing as well as classroom observations to test out the constructs in the C-COI. These processes resulted in an instrument with rigorous validation procedures and a high inter-rater reliability.

10.1093/iwc/iwu022,"Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.

Students reported significant gains in all five computing attitude constructs (definition, comfort, interest, classroom applications, and career/future use). Further analyses revealed male students had significantly greater gains than females in the career/future use construct, and there were no significant differences when controlling for completion of prior engineering design coursework (PEDC). Additionally, while the majority (77%) of students indicated they preferred physical computing over screen-based experiences for future computing lessons, analyses found gender and PEDC were not significant predictors of students’ preference for learning computing concepts. This study provides implications for improving computer science instruction within authentic STEM contexts.

10.1002/sce.21771,"Computationally intensive science (CIS)‐related disciplines and careers are predicted to be among the cutting‐edge fields and high‐demand jobs. Such disciplines and careers demand expertise in both traditional scientific knowledge and computer science (CS)‐related understanding and skills. Preparing educational systems for developing interest and abilities for such career paths require a new set of research tools. In this study, we developed and validated a multidimensional instrument called computationally intensive science career interests (CISCI) to measure middle school students' interests in CIS careers. We also explored several predictors of students' interests in such careers and examined the impact of a 4‐day online synchronous scientific computational modeling activity on students' career interests. A total of 934 Indonesian middle school students (aged 11–14) participated in this study. A combination of the classical test theory and item response theory approaches was used to validate the CISCI instrument. Multiple linear regression tests were run to identify the predictors of students' career interests, and paired‐sample t‐tests were used to examine a scientific computational modeling activity's impact on students' career interests. The results revealed that CISCI was a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument to measure students' career interests. We also found that science and CS attitudes, computational thinking, and prior experience in CS‐related activities were significant predictors of students' career interests. In addition, computational modeling activity significantly influenced the frequency of students discussing such career paths with their parents. This study underscores the importance of engaging students in CS‐integrated science learning activities to help develop their interests in CIS jobs.

10.1007/s10956-022-09996-7,"Programming and automation continue to evolve rapidly and advance the capabilities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, physical computing (the integration of programming and interactive physical devices) integrated within biomedical contexts remains an area of limited focus in secondary STEM education programs. As this is an emerging area, many educators may not be well prepared to teach physical computing concepts within authentic biomedical contexts. This shortcoming provided the rationale for this study, to examine if professional development (PD) had a noticeable influence on high school science and technology and engineering (T&E) teachers' (1) perceptions of teaching biomedical and computational thinking (CT) concepts and (2) plans to integrate physical computing within the context of authentic biomedical engineering challenges. The findings revealed a significant difference in the amount of biomedical and CT concepts that teachers planned to implement as a result of the PD. Using a modified version of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-A) Riggs and Enochs in Science Education,74(6), 625–637 (1990), analyses revealed significant gains in teachers' self-efficacy toward teaching both biomedical and CT concepts from the PD. Further analyses revealed that teachers reported increases in their perceived knowledge of biomedical and CT concepts and a significant increase in their intent to collaborate with a science or T&E educator outside of their content area. This study provides implications for researchers and educators to integrate more biomedical and physical computing instruction at the secondary education level.

10.24320/redie.2023.25.e03.4326,"This paper describes how educational communities perceive the stimulation of 21st-century skills in students. A quantitative approach was employed, following a descriptive non-experimental research design, with a sample of 692 subjects comprising teachers, students, and parents and guardians. The results reveal a perceived lack of stimulation of digital skills like robotics, electronics, and the development of mobile applications; social skills like taking a rights-based or gender-based approach; emotional skills like self-care and resilience; and cognitive skills like creative and computational thinking. In conclusion, educational communities exhibit only a moderate perception of the stimulation of 21st-century skills, which demonstrates a need to strengthen initiatives to promote these skills in the education system.

Activities designed to engage girls and young women with computing, emphasizing computational thinking and cybersecurity knowledge and awareness, and to illuminate a pathway forward are hosted and facilitated through Alliance partnerships. The authors will describe a project-based approach to facilitating learning among K-12 students. By engaging students at an early age, we believe we can promote the development of selfefficacy in computing before adolescent opinions are formed that may discourage girls from seeking curricular or co-curricular experiences in computing. Further, we will describe how the MSAWC is illuminating the path for girls and women in the state, to engage them with computing and to influence their persistence on the computing pathway through college and into the workforce, using collective impact strategy.

10.1111/bjet.12744,"The addition of computing to England's National Curriculum was welcomed as a much‐needed modernization of the country's digital skills curriculum, replacing a poorly regarded ICT program of study with an industry‐supported scheme of computer science, robotics and computational thinking. This paper will demonstrate how teachers have acted as gatekeepers to block a curriculum that they view as narrow, difficult to teach and in conflict with their beliefs and practices as educational professionals. Extensive qualitative data were collected through classroom observations, teacher and student interviews and student artifact creation in four state‐maintained primary school classrooms to explore how teachers acted agentically to minimize or altogether reject a legally mandated curriculum that clashed with their local, professional knowledge. Analysis of this data was supported by official documents and personal accounts of the creation of the computing program of study, which highlight a discourse of economic anxiety and post‐imperialist nostalgia on the part of the curriculum's designers. This study will illuminate the significant influence that teachers wield as gatekeepers for subject content, with the ability to reject digital technology curricula even when it is supported by industry and mandated by law.

This article seeks to understand this new way of thinking and, although the philosophy of science deeply analyzes the traditional way of scientific thinking, Computational Sciences are still an unknown terrain for it. Because it is difficult to ask the right questions when you do not have concepts, theories or frameworks to formulate them. In addition, while people believe that they are aware of and properly understand the object of most sciences, not all are well understood. For example, although Nature Sciences study the world to develop new knowledge about the universe, what new ideas can be found in a device made by man as the computer? For that reason, some affirm that the Computer Sciences are an abstract field, as the mathematics, and that they do not really treat of computers, but of another thing. That is why they are still a scientific discipline that is still a source of much confusion. This article aims to develop an understanding of Computer Sciences.

10.1007/s11423-023-10272-7,"Analyzing qualitative data from learning processes is considered “messy” and time consuming (Chi in J Learn Sci 6(3):271–315, 1997). It is often challenging to summarize and synthesize such data in a manner that conveys the richness and complexity of learning processes in a clear and concise manner. Moreover, qualitative data often contains patterns that are not immediately apparent. Consequently, visualization can be an effective tool for representing and unpacking the complexities and multidimensions of learning processes. Additionally, visualizations provide a time-efficient approach to analyzing data and a high-level view of the learning process over time for researchers to zoom in on intriguing moments and patterns (Huang et al. in Comput Human Behav 87:480–492, 2018). In this conceptual paper, we provide a broad overview of research in the field of visualizing qualitative data and discuss two studies (1) visualizing role-changing patterns in an interdisciplinary learning environment and (2) operationalizing collaborative computational thinking practices via visualization. By leveraging these studies, we aim to demonstrate a visualization processing flow along with qualitative research and methods. Particularly, the processing flow includes three critical elements: research subjectivity, complexity of visual encoding, and purpose of visual encoding. The discussion highlights the iterative and creative nature of the visualization technique. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits, challenges, and limitations of using visualization in the context of qualitative studies.

The proliferation of technological tools and programming environments offers the opportunity for creative coding activities for children and increases the need for appropriate instructional practices. In this study, we design and evaluate a coding workshop for children. Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured. • We designed and evaluated a coding workshop for children. • We examined gender differences using eye-tracking and interviews. • We found no-statistically significant gender difference in gaze and learning gain during coding. • We found gender differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding. • Females do not lack in competences but simply have a different approach during coding.

10.1007/s13384-024-00742-z,"Coding and computational thinking are being hailed as the new literacy for the twenty-first century, and have become increasingly common in schools world-wide. At the same time, the sector is facing a global shortage of technology teachers, and technology lessons are frequently being delivered by non-specialist teachers. Therefore, some have suggested integrating coding into other curricula as a practical solution for non-specialist teachers to deliver outcomes in both Digital Technologies and their own subject areas, whilst also developing general capabilities. To better understand the benefits and practicality of integrating coding into the English curriculum, we present a detailed case study of an Australian Year 5/6 classroom where students engaged in learning units integrating both Digital Technologies and English curriculum outcomes. We explored the nature of students’ interdisciplinary learning and general capabilities development through two learning units in which they coded animated narratives (CANs). We also built understanding of how non-specialist teachers in regular classrooms can develop the necessary technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to facilitate cross-curricular learning involving coding, and at the same time, promote general curriculum capabilities. Findings challenge the commonly held assumption that integrating coding can be a universal solution to specialist staff shortages and an overcrowded curriculum, and reveal the challenges faced by non-specialist teachers and school organisations that need to be overcome for successful implementation. However, they also indicate that when these challenges are met, integrated approaches can result in interdisciplinary learning, high levels of student engagement, and provide effective environments for general capability development.

10.1016/j.cogdev.2024.101463,"Block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure ('states') are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children's building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with ""computational thinking"". • We use novel analytic methods to characterize children's block building. • 4- to 8-year-old children are highly selective in their building sequences. • 4- to 8-year-old children use a layer-by-layer principle in their building. • Our findings offer new insights into how children build efficiently and accurately, reflecting the child's ""computational mind"".

This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.

10.1177/1046878119901286,"Background: Recent years have seen the resurgence of board games designed for entertainment, and to teach or explicate real life problems. The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games.

From video data of 20 students using a graphical programming interface, we identified ideas that were shared and evolved through an elementary school classroom. In mapping these ideas and their resulting changes in programs and outputs, we were able to identify the contextual features which contributed to how ideas moved through the classroom as students learned. We suggest this process of idea mapping in visual programming environments as a viable method for understanding collaborative, constructivist learning as well as a context under which experiences can be developed to improve student learning.

,"This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). The Group-based Cloud Computing (GbCC) for STEM Education Project investigates pre-service teacher designing, developing, implementing, and enacting a sociotechnological system for group-centered STEM teaching and learning consistent with a nationally recognized pre-service program. The project takes a design-based research approach to creating and studying technologies and materials that support generative teaching and learning in STEM. Computational thinking, including agent-based modeling, and simulation across STEM domains as well as geo-spatial reasoning about personally meaningful learner-collected data will provides an important scientific foundation for the project. This will be achieved by developing a highly-interactive and group-optimized, browser- and cloud-based, deviceindependent and open-source architecture and by integrating and extending leading computational tools including the NSF-funded NetLogo Web agent-based modeling language and environment.

,"Research identifies a national urgency to improve teacher performance and student achievement in science and engineering. This paper responds to this need and presents the results of seven-years of Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs funded by the National Science Foundation in which engineering faculty collaborate with middle and high school teachers and their students. One program (3 years) is a comprehensive teacher professional development program in which middle school teachers participate in an intensive summer research experience in computer science and engineering labs, build curriculum based on the laboratory research content that they learn, participate in lesson study, and implement new curriculum in their middle classrooms. The second program (4 years) is a high school teacher RET program with similar components. This paper reports the results of both of the RET programs. The two programs had the combined intent of bringing innovative computer science and engineering research to middle and high school teachers and their students and improving teacher performance, while simultaneously improving student achievement through scientific inquiry, engaging students in computational thinking, and engineering design. The programs' design included a summer intensive experience in which teachers fully participated in a computer science or engineering laboratory research and engaged in an inquiry focused content-to-pedagogy teacher professional development workshop, building curriculum from their lab research experience with foci on scientific experimentation and improving students' science achievement and literacy. The programs were both aligned with Common Core Math Standards and Next Generation Science Standards and addressed the research question: What is the impact of an intensive research-based teacher professional development program on teacher and student performance?

,"The classical macroscopic presentation of the second law of thermodynamics is an elegant but abstract sequence of very specific thought experiments that utilize reversible processes occurring within heat engines operating between infinite temperature reservoirs. The length, specificity and complexity of this sequence may hamper the understanding of important concepts such as exergy and entropy. The pedagogical problems of this approach have been discussed, followed by an alternative presentation wherein second law concepts and formulations have been derived from thought experiments that use real, rather than imaginary processes. The thought experiments involve classifying heat transfer at any local point for any arbitrary process involving work-heat interactions into different categories, and then collecting terms for each category throughout the control volume in order to relate property changes to external heat transfer and/or work. They embrace the spatial non-uniformity present in any real process, are consistent with contemporary computational approaches, and can potentially serve as building blocks for the development of computational thinking in students. An assessment plan with limited sample size has been described. The primary purpose of this paper to interest other thermodynamics instructors in the proposed presentation so that the assessment can be performed with a large number of students.

,"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) administers its Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) study once every three years to assess the scholastic performance of fifteen-year-old students in the field of mathematics, science and reading. This study is conducted among OECD member nations and select non-member nations. Results from the PISA study consistently show that, on average, the United States ranks poorly in mathematics when compared against most of the other OECD member nations. While disparity in math proficiency may exist between states and opinions may differ on the way samples were collected from each nation for the study, the generally poor proficiency in mathematics among students at the K-12 level has serious implications as they advance into undergraduate studies, especially in STEM fields. Students who lack strong fundamentals in mathematics at the K-12 level will find themselves struggling to overcome the steep learning curve in courses discussing the concepts of calculus and differential equations when they are also already grappling with simpler concepts such as basic trigonometry and linear algebra. This constant struggle could lead to demotivation among students and retention issues in STEM colleges. Various literature highlights the difficulties that students face when learning mathematics, and numerous pedagogical discussions were made with the hope that the teaching of mathematics can be done more efficiently and more effectively. Yet the fact that the United States, as a whole, shows little improvement, if any, in the PISA rankings for math proficiency in the past decade indicates that there are underlying problems which may not be solved by just proposing new teaching methods. In this paper, we inspect the merits of emphasizing the fundamentals of mathematics and how a solid grounding in mathematics can be founded on ""trivial"" methods, as well as how they can be invaluable to help students segue into developing their computational thinking skills. The factors that lead to an apparent stagnation in math proficiency among students are identified and discussed to ascertain whether new teaching methods are the answer to improving math proficiency among students. We consider the observations made by instructors from Texas Tech University about the apparently poor mastery of basic mathematical skills among freshmen engineering students. These instructors teach an introductory course that covers mathematical methods to solve problems on trigonometry, systems of linear equations, quadratic equations, sample statistics, vectors, etc. These observations, coupled with higher expectations by universities on their students, provide the motivation for the discussion that will follow in this paper. Finally, we discuss a path forward for engineering undergraduate students who are struggling to keep up with the mastery of pre-college mathematical skills needed prior to pursuing their engineering core courses.

10.1016/j.chb.2023.107903,"Despite the significant emphasis placed on incorporating 21st century skills into the educational framework, particularly at the primary level, recent scholarly works indicate considerable variation in the implementation of these skills across different countries and regions, suggesting a demand for further research specifically focusing on primary education. The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context.

However, little is known about the relationship between a teacher’s unique instructional style and their students’ ability to explore and retain programming content. In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from N = 6 teachers and N = 222 Kindergarten through second grade students at six schools across the United States. These teachers and students participated in an investigation of the relationship between teaching styles and student learning outcomes. All participants engaged in a minimum of two lessons and a maximum of seven lessons using the ScratchJr programming environment to introduce coding. Teachers reported on their classroom structure, lesson plan, teaching style and comfort with technology. They also administered ScratchJr Solve It assessments to capture various aspects of students’ programming comprehension, which were analyzed for trends in learning outcomes. Results from this descriptive, exploratory study show that all students were successful in attaining foundational ScratchJr programming comprehension. Statistically significant findings revealed higher programming achievement in students whose educators demonstrated flexibility in lesson planning, responsiveness to student needs, technological content expertise, and concern for developing students’ independent thinking. Implications for research in the development of computational thinking strategies are discussed, as well as suggestions for successfully implementing early childhood classroom interventions with ScratchJr. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Technology & Design Education is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Students solved tasks that were designed to involve programming, and they were encouraged to engage in activities of prediction and reflection. I provide data from two paired teaching experiments, and I outline how the task design and instructional interventions particularly supported students' combinatorial reasoning. I argue that emergent computational representations and the prompts for prediction and reflection were especially useful in supporting students' reasoning about fundamental combinatorial ideas. I argue that this particular mathematical example informs broader notions of disciplinary reflexivity and representational heterogeneity, providing insight into computational thinking practices in the domain of mathematics. Ultimately, I aim to explore the nature of computing and enumeration, shedding light on why the two disciplines are particularly well-suited to support each other.

Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms. • We present a study on strategies to teach coding and computational thinking in young children. • We found children (3–5 years old) onwards used KIBO to learn fundamental coding concepts. • We found children developed positive behaviors in a learning environment of coding as playground. • We study the effective integration of robotics in different cultural and economic contexts. • We found teachers integrated effectively coding and computational thinking in their curriculums.

10.1371/journal.pbio.2003082,"This article describes efforts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2013 to 2016 to train a national workforce in biomedical data science. We provide an analysis of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) training program strengths and weaknesses with an eye toward future directions aimed at any funder and potential funding recipient worldwide. The focus is on extramurally funded programs that have a national or international impact rather than the training of NIH staff, which was addressed by the NIH’s internal Data Science Workforce Development Center. From its inception, the major goal of BD2K was to narrow the gap between needed and existing biomedical data science skills. As biomedical research increasingly relies on computational, mathematical, and statistical thinking, supporting the training and education of the workforce of tomorrow requires new emphases on analytical skills. From 2013 to 2016, BD2K jump-started training in this area for all levels, from graduate students to senior researchers.

,"Pair programming (PP) is a useful approach to fostering computational thinking for young students. However, there are many factors impacting on the effectiveness of PP. The period of switching roles between the driver and the navigator is often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of the switching period on PP. We conducted a PP experiment in four classes in the sixth grade in a primary school. The results indicated that (a) the semi-free switch was more effective for the learning achievement than the fixed periods, and the preference for adopting the fixed time interval to switch roles existed in previous studies seems to be a kind of prejudice; (b) students who switched roles every 5 minutes and semi-freely were more enjoyable than those who switched roles in every task and in every class session. Moreover, the period of switching roles in every class session decreased students' enjoyment after PP; (c) the frequency of switching roles decreased significantly, but the negotiation between the driver and the navigator became more active with time going in the semi-free class. Implications for teaching are also discussed.

10.31908/19098367.3551,"In order to design reusable processes by structuring and designing activities for teams of people through Collaboration Engineering, the Research and Development Group in Software Engineering (IDIS) of the University of Cauca, has proposed the model ChildProgramming-C, which seeks to make a contribution from the Collaborative Engineering approach to the ChildProgramming Software development model. In the progress of the investigation two exploratory case studies have been carried out with children of an Educational institution, where it was evidenced that in spite of theoretically proposing collaborative activities for children to learn to develop software, during practice there are situations that do not guarantee positive interdependence, individual responsibility and equal participation, as fundamental characteristics of collaborative work. Therefore, a preliminary phase is proposed to the Childprogramming model, which seeks to sensitize children about the importance of collaboration by being part of a team, through ludic strategies, allowing the development of social, cognitive and computational thinking skills. This article shows the experience of the sensitization phase and the evaluation through the application of a confirmatory case study.

10.1111/bjet.12355,"International changes in policy and curricula (notably recent developments in England) have led to a focus on the role of computing education in the early years. As interest in the potential of computing education has increased, there has been a proliferation of programming tools designed for young children. While these changes are broadly to be welcomed, the pace of change has arguably led to more attention to the tools than to key questions about pedagogy. This paper proposes three areas of research (Logo; computational thinking; and teaching STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics) that may inform computing education for young children and suggests that a greater focus on thinking skills and connections to manifestations of computers in the real world is needed. Above all, the paper calls for an informed debate about the trend towards introducing computing education to children in the early years.

The search for 'number neurons' and neural correlates of computational thinking aims to identify biological primitives to explain the emergence of number sense. This work typically looks for the sources of number sense in organisms, but one might extend this search and study the possibility of a calculating matter more generally. Such a speculative project explores the implications of the non-human turn within the posthumanities. In this paper, I draw primarily on the work of Vicky Kirby and Gilles Deleuze in order to focus on becomingmonster through calculation. I show how calculation, as a machinic and empirical act that both serves and troubles images of mathematical truth, has always played a unique role in the production of mathematical monsters. I then discuss calculating children who participate in abacus clubs and annual abacus competitions, calculating at inhuman rates with imaginary abacuses. I argue that a new materialist philosophy of immanence demands a radically new approach to number sense.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104173,"Several gaps exist in the literature on coding. First, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms. • Two authentic classrooms of 2nd graders and their teachers. • Use of multiple data sources. • Focus on task engagement as an essential construct. • Both teacher and student voices included.

Using Python within Rhino software, students translated architectural formal compositions into algorithmic representations through code writing. The model guided students through steps such as analyzing architectural geometry, creating algorithmic flows, and developing scripts to automatically generate form variations. Challenges arose from students' limited familiarity with Textual Programming Languages (TPLs) and the requisite mathematical knowledge for detailed geometric analyses. Despite initial hurdles, students exhibited genuine algorithmic thinking, successfully creating algorithmic representations of architectural forms. Survey results underscored the model's efficacy in promoting research skills while offering a fresh perspective on architectural form. The study emphasizes the vital role of integrating computational design skills into architectural education early on, equipping students with essential tools for innovative design exploration.

In this context, music represents both a mean and a goal: in fact, from one side coding activities are based on music processes that are able to unveil algorithmic thinking; from the other side, such processes may stimulate creativity and collaborative learning, and their audio feedback is immediately perceivable. Consequently, music can represent a valid learning tool as well as an addictive reinforcement technique to approach coding.

,"Reflective writings, the contextualization of learning experiences, and the application of learning to real life all facilitate the transfer of interdisciplinary learning. Such strategies include making explicit to students the need for such a transfer, advising them to follow the appropriate course sequence, emphasizing material they need to transfer to other courses, practicing transfer by inviting guest lecturers, developing metacognitive skills, and reinforcing concepts by using them in different contexts. As the transfer of learning does not occur automatically, curricular and course design should intentionally emphasize the connection between courses. Problem Solving with Computer Programming (PS) is a required course for first-year computer systems majors, offering an ideal opportunity to establish a transfer structure. To make students aware of the connections between PS and English Composition (EG1), another required course, and to facilitate the transfer of skills, we developed a learning community (LC) linking these courses. This innovative approach to teaching computing and writing to first-year computer systems majors at a college of technology uses programming narratives as its theme. Students write and implement narratives using computer programming to develop a narrative-driven video game prototype. They use Alice, a three-dimensional animation software (www.alice.org).9,10 The LC emphasizes the importance of connecting courses in the major and those in general education. The LC builds on our previous research, which found that introducing narrative elements into problem-solving courses improves overall student performance and computer programming-related problem-solving skills in particular. This study presents best practices and lessons learned from our LC, and we present three novel strategies to integrate writing in PS courses for majors and non-majors. First, since implementation of LCs is not always feasible, to infuse narrative elements into problem-solving we developed a narrative module to help students develop narrative and writing skills that can be incorporated in all sections of the PS course. Second, we developed a series of student-assessed case studies that can be integrated in all sections of the PS course for computer systems majors. Cases studies provide a narrative context in which students learn basic constructs of computer programming such as sequencing, selection and repetition structures. Third, we created a general education interdisciplinary course, Programming Narratives: Computer Animated Storytelling, open to non-computer majors, which emphasize creative writing and computational thinking. In this interdisciplinary course, students learn the structure of narrative, concepts of problem solving, and the logic of computer programming languages as they develop a narrative-driven video game prototype. This process helps students achieve the college-wide learning goal of making meaningful and multiple connections among the liberal arts as well as between the liberal arts and the areas of study leading to a major or profession.

,"This paper presents the development of a curriculum of CS 1 course, which conveys the basics of programming techniques and concepts of Computer Science (CS). To build a solid foundation for prospective CS majors, while also attract students from other subject areas, a new pedagogy of programming was adopted by using MIT App Inventor. It is a blocks-based programming environment that enables students to create apps for Android devices without worrying about syntax. We developed a series of hand-on modules into the course work. Thus, students were motivated to make a grater effort to learn the concepts embodied in the modules. Through this engaging and intriguing method, the freshly designed curriculum helped students master a number of vital skills in problem solving, computational thinking, design, and teamwork. Pre-survey and post-survey were conducted to study the acceptance of the new teaching method. The study indicated the curriculum not only helped motivate students from all majors, but also improved their performance.

,"This paper discusses a challenge-based, collaborative, community-situated STEM learning environment - C3STEM that is aligned with the next generation science standards. In C3STEM, students synergistically learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and CS (Computer Science) concepts by solving realistic problems that provide a framework for applying scientific and engineering practices. A recent study conducted with 26 high school students in middle Tennessee showed that our approach resulted in the students making significant learning gains in both fundamental STEM and computational concepts. Furthermore, they were successful in working collaboratively in small groups to find good solutions to an overall challenge problem on optimizing traffic flow through adjacent city intersections. We discuss how students worked through the two components of the C3STEM system: CTSiM (Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling) and C2SuMo (Collaborative Cloud-based Scaled up Modeling), present the experimental study we conducted, and discuss the results in detail.

10.15700/saje.v41n4a1959,"Several teachers have recently started introducing coding into their teaching in primary schools. This comes on the back of the emerging prominence of educational technology and the teaching of computational skills at school level, in light of the country's policy commitment to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Coding has been punted as 1 of 2 essential subjects to be launched in schools countrywide from 2020; the other being robotics. In this article we focus on the implementation of coding as a subject in selected Foundation Phase classes in the Western Cape. We aim to gain an understanding of coding as a subject from the perspective of teachers who are implementing this very new subject in the Foundation Phase. We specifically discuss the experiences and challenges of teachers who have been teaching the subject over the last few years, based on in-depth qualitative interviews with 4 Foundation Phase teachers. Overall, we provide a set of considerations for the optimal implementation of coding as a subject in Foundation Phase in South African schools. The participants' experiences highlight the challenges associated with implementation, teachers' pedagogical skills and competences, and resource requirements. We raise the following areas that need to be addressed for the successful implementation of coding: professional development addressing teaching methodologies on the development of computational thinking skills in young learners, providing support for teachers, addressing time constraints in the teaching of the subject, and providing resources.

10.1109/MS.2014.128,"There have been many periods in the unfolding of human history when we have asserted that it was possible to catalog all that was known or that could be known. Ignoring the pragmatic reality of trying to catalog an ever-expanding corpus, one must understand that such a task is further complicated by cultural and situational bias: what is important to know at one place and time is not necessary important in another. So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing?

10.3311/PPar.10335,"Digital technologies have enabled new design methods, casting a reassessment of current theories of design. Rivka Oxman proposed five paradigmatic classes of digital design models according to the various relationships between the designer, conceptual content, applied design processes, and the design object. Kotnik states that catenary curve computational thinking is changing the way we think and design in architecture; it can be distinguished by three main levels of ""computability"": representational, parametric and algorithmic. Kolarevic clarifies that new digital approaches to design (based on computational concepts), construction and prototyping can be achieved by computerised numerical control process (CNC). The study aims to promote the integration of theory and practice in search of a feedback loop that promotes the scientific method of knowledge production. The theoretical work intends to develop an updated understanding of the use of digital technologies. The practical experimentation analyses the Sagrada Família, designed by Antoni Gaudí, and proposes to compare digital (through the software Rhinoceros and the plug-in Grasshopper) and handmade physical models from the concept of catenary used by the Catalan architect.

10.1111/edth.12168,"In this essay, Amy Voss Farris and Pratim Sengupta argue that a democratic approach to children's computing education in a science class must focus on the aesthetics of children's experience. In Democracy and Education, Dewey links 'democracy' with a distinctive understanding of 'experience.' For Dewey, the value of educational experiences lies in 'the unity or integrity of experience.' In Art as Experience, Dewey presents aesthetic experience as the fundamental form of human experience that undergirds all other forms of experiences and that can bring together multiple forms of experiences, locating this form of experience in the work of artists. Particularly relevant to the focus of this essay, computational literacy, Dewey calls the process through which a person transforms a material into an expressive medium an aesthetic experience. Farris and Sengupta argue that the kind of experience that is appropriate for a democratic education in the context of children's computational science is essentially aesthetic in nature. Given that aesthetics has received relatively little attention in STEM education research, the authors' purpose here is to highlight the power of Deweyan aesthetic experience in making computational thinking available and attractive to all children, including those who are disinterested in computing, and especially those who are likely to be discounted by virtue of location, gender, or race.

10.1186/1471-2164-16-S12-S10,"Background: Transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is usually accomplished by cooperative transcription factors (TFs). Computational identification of cooperative TF pairs has become a hot research topic and many algorithms have been proposed in the literature. A typical algorithm for predicting cooperative TF pairs has two steps. (Step 1) Define the targets of each TF under study. (Step 2) Design a measure for calculating the cooperativity of a TF pair based on the targets of these two TFs. While different algorithms have distinct sophisticated cooperativity measures, the targets of a TF are usually defined using ChIP-chip data. However, there is an inherent weakness in using ChIP-chip data to define the targets of a TF. ChIP-chip analysis can only identify the binding targets of a TF but it cannot distinguish the true regulatory from the binding but non-regulatory targets of a TF. Results: This work is the first study which aims to investigate whether the performance of computational identification of cooperative TF pairs could be improved by using a more biologically relevant way to define the targets of a TF. For this purpose, we propose four simple algorithms, all of which consist of two steps. (Step 1) Define the targets of a TF using (i) ChIP-chip data in the first algorithm, (ii) TF binding data in the second algorithm, (iii) TF perturbation data in the third algorithm, and (iv) the intersection of TF binding and TF perturbation data in the fourth algorithm. Compared with the first three algorithms, the fourth algorithm uses a more biologically relevant way to define the targets of a TF. (Step 2) Measure the cooperativity of a TF pair by the statistical significance of the overlap of the targets of these two TFs using the hypergeometric test. By adopting four existing performance indices, we show that the fourth proposed algorithm (PA4) significantly out performs the other three proposed algorithms. This suggests that the computational identification of cooperative TF pairs is indeed improved when using a more biologically relevant way to define the targets of a TF. Strikingly, the prediction results of our simple PA4 are more biologically meaningful than those of the 12 existing sophisticated algorithms in the literature, all of which used ChIP-chip data to define the targets of a TF. This suggests that properly defining the targets of a TF may be more important than designing sophisticated cooperativity measures. In addition, our PA4 has the power to predict several experimentally validated cooperative TF pairs, which have not been successfully predicted by any existing algorithms in the literature. Conclusions: This study shows that the performance of computationalidentification of cooperative TF pairs could be improved by using a more biologically relevant way to define the targets of a TF. The main contribution of this study is not to propose another new algorithm but to provide a new thinking for the research of computational identification of cooperative TF pairs. Researchers should put more effort on properly defining the targets of a TF (i. e. Step 1) rather than totally focus on designing sophisticated cooperativity measures (i.e. Step 2). The lists of TF target genes, the Matlab codes and the prediction results of the four proposed algorithms could be downloaded from our companion website http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/TFI.

10.1016/j.poetic.2018.04.007,"This paper outlines some provisional steps toward a theory of culture grounded in computational thinking. I begin by describing computational thinking, drawing on Marr’s hierarchy for the analysis of information processing systems. I then address the definition of culture, arguing that culture is a property of causal chains, rather than a thing-in-the-world. I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.

10.1109/TE.2017.2705152,"Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students’ achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students’ motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students’ grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004208,"The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the ability of biologists to collect large amounts of data. It is therefore vital that research biologists acquire the necessary skills during their training to visualize, analyze, and interpret such data. To begin to meet this need, we have developed a “boot camp” in quantitative methods for biology graduate students at Harvard Medical School. The goal of this short, intensive course is to enable students to use computational tools to visualize and analyze data, to strengthen their computational thinking skills, and to simulate and thus extend their intuition about the behavior of complex biological systems. The boot camp teaches basic programming using biological examples from statistics, image processing, and data analysis. This integrative approach to teaching programming and quantitative reasoning motivates students’ engagement by demonstrating the relevance of these skills to their work in life science laboratories. Students also have the opportunity to analyze their own data or explore a topic of interest in more detail. The class is taught with a mixture of short lectures, Socratic discussion, and in-class exercises. Students spend approximately 40% of their class time working through both short and long problems. A high instructor-to-student ratio allows students to get assistance or additional challenges when needed, thus enhancing the experience for students at all levels of mastery. Data collected from end-of-course surveys from the last five offerings of the course (between 2012 and 2014) show that students report high learning gains and feel that the course prepares them for solving quantitative and computational problems they will encounter in their research. We outline our course here which, together with the course materials freely available online under a Creative Commons License, should help to facilitate similar efforts by others.

10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105669,"Much of our thinking focuses on deciding what to do in situations where the space of possible options is too large to evaluate exhaustively. Previous work has found that people do this by learning the general value of different behaviors, and prioritizing thinking about high-value options in new situations. Is this good-action bias always the best strategy, or can thinking about low-value options sometimes become more beneficial? Can people adapt their thinking accordingly based on the situation? And how do we know what to think about in novel events? Here, we developed a block-puzzle paradigm that enabled us to measure people's thinking plans and compare them to a computational model of rational thought. We used two distinct response methods to explore what people think about—a self-report method, in which we asked people explicitly to report what they thought about, and an implicit response time method, in which we used people's decision-making times to reveal what they thought about. Our results suggest that people can quickly estimate the apparent value of different options and use this to decide what to think about. Critically, we find that people can flexibly prioritize whether to think about high-value options (Experiments 1 and 2) or low-value options (Experiments 3, 4, and 5), depending on the problem. Through computational modeling, we show that these thinking strategies are broadly rational, enabling people to maximize the value of long-term decisions. Our results suggest that thinking plans are flexible: What we think about depends on the structure of the problems we are trying to solve.

Research demonstrates that it is challenging to introduce Informatics in schools without well-prepared teachers. In this paper, we examine Lithuanian teachers' perceptions of the barriers and drivers to integrate the renewed Informatics curricula in primary education and the relation between them. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. The results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn Informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating Informatics. The study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of Informatics. The study provides knowledge that could, for instance, benefit teacher training programmes and help better understand how teachers can be better supported to meet current and future challenges. • Integration of Informatics is highly dependent on the motivation of teachers. • Support from colleagues is perceived by teachers as the most influencing barrier. • The most perceived barrier and driver is Explicit guidelines for renewed curricula. • Critical role lies in resources, tools, and guidelines for implementing Informatics. • School leadership is important in the provision of infrastructure and support [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Computers & Education is the property of Pergamon Press - An Imprint of Elsevier Science and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges' g ‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g ‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g ‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g ‾ s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared. • Computer programming interventions show moderate to large effect sizes per se. • Studies focusing on physicality are especially effective. • Instructional approaches exhibit moderate to large effects. • Study design features only explain marginal variation in the effects. • Visualizing programming with Scratch is especially effective.

Here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of Embodied Cognition. Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors. • 16 students generated 368 representational gestures to explain 3 computing concepts. • Analysis revealed two embodied metaphors to communicate constructs and processes. • Findings support claim that thinking in computing is embodied. • Implications discussed for use of gestures and tool design in computing education.

However, little research has been carried out exploring these ideas. This study analysed data collected while 5- and 6-year-old students in a New Zealand primary school were using Scratch Jnr. to learn about basic shapes, as part of a numeracy topic. Analysis combined Brennan and Resnick's (2012) computational thinking skills framework and Krathwohl's (2002) revision of Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate any role general thinking skills played in these students' coding work. Results suggest including basic coding in primary curricula provides teachers with an effective means of exercising their students' general and higher order thinking skills. They build on Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework by including conceptualization as an important element in students' computational work and highlight the role of predictive thinking in debugging code. Findings support historical arguments that more needs to be done to investigate students' cognitive processes when undertaking computational work. Lay description What is already known about the topic: Computational learning is an emerging area of school curricula;, Limited research exists exploring thinking processes within computational learning;, Early studies challenge more recent claims of thinking skill transfer from computational work., What this paper adds: Computational work supports a range of general and higher order thinking skills;, Task design and teacher skills are critical to achieving higher order thinking outcomes from computational work;, Computational work in teams can support collaborative, cooperative and self-management key competencies., Implications for practice and/or policy: Findings broaden the base of empirical support for including computational work in school curricula;, Coding provides an engaging means of exercising complex thinking skills and key competencies in students;, The data methods used provide teachers with visible evidence of students' thinking processes during computational work.

Many teachers' preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers' understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling.

By exploring how early cinema and digital film can be coupled to textile as technology, more specifically through the mechanisms of the sewing machine and the Jacquard loom, it extends the historical span from the mid-1890s, with the invention of cinema as projection, to the early 1800s, when computational thinking was successfully implemented as weaving technique. Instead of focusing on film and fashion as means of visual representation, the author relies on the concept of inscription for a better understanding of both cinema (as recording of light and movement) and textile (with its various thread techniques of weaving, stitching, knitting, etc.).

The analyses are based on video recordings of peer feedback activities within the context of a project on computational thinking using the software Scratch. Drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, the interactional and collaborative accomplishment of design critique is examined, focusing on how the participants make relevant norms and values concerning what constitutes a 'good' game. The results of the study show that the children and their teacher orient to different themes that concern aesthetic, functional, and ethical aspects of the games and the design process, at the same time as a moral order in and for the conduct of critique is accomplished in interaction. The study sheds light on the emergence of a local culture of critique as the children learn to formulate and respond to peer feedback, thus negotiating and developing digital literacy.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104623,"This study analyzed 281 lesson plans collected from the producers' websites of 12 educational physical computing and robotics (ePCR) devices. We extracted and coded five variables from each lesson. They were ePCR functionality, coding skills, computational thinking skills, math knowledge, and activity design. First, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three ePCR-related knowledge: ePCR functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students ePCR technology in middle-grade math lessons. Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects. Implications for educators and researchers were discussed at the end of the article. • We analyze 281 physical-computing-and-robotics lesson plans in middle-grade math. • We identify three types of technology integration. • We identify five types of integrated lesson plans. • The largest lesson-plan category is math learning in technology creation projects. • Transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons only count for 5% of lesson plans.

10.1111/tgis.12040,"One of the fundamental issues of geographical information science is to design GIS interfaces and functionalities in a way that is easy to understand, teach, and use. Unfortunately, current geographical information systems (including ArcGIS) remains very difficult to use as spatial analysis tools, because they organize and expose functionalities according to GIS data structures and processing algorithms. As a result, GIS interfaces are conceptually confusing, cognitively complex, and semantically disconnected from the way human reason about spatial analytical activities. In this article, we propose an approach that structures GIS analytical functions based on the notion of 'analytical intent'. We describe an experiment that replaces ArcGIS desktop interface with a conversational interface, to enable mixed-initiative user-system interactions at the level of analytical intentions. We initially focus on the subset of GIS functions that are relevant to ' finding what's inside' as described by Mitchell, but the general principles apply to other types of spatial analysis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of delegating some spatial thinking tasks to computational agents, and also raises future research questions that are key to building a better theory of spatial thinking with GIS.

10.1177/1094342017738352,"The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets.

Three additional parent-child dyads participated in a follow-up observational study, in which they were videotaped while working on an open-ended ScratchJr activity. Findings indicated that parents reported engaging as observers and coaches, whereas children engaged as planners. There were moderate, positive associations between children's prior coding interest and their engagement in debugging, as well as between children's role as playmates and their engagement in the design process.

We draw on experiences with the research project 'Reconfiguring Computing Through Cyberfeminism and New Materialism' (CF+), during which we collaboratively investigated modes and methods of knowledge production in computing. Cyberfeminist legacies and new materialism provided a historically informed and theoretically rigorous set of concerns around which artistic research and computing were brought together. We discuss collaborative experiments and three hybrid methodologies – creating situations for intra-action, diffractive reading/making and material speculation – that we employed and suggest that what emerged is a kind of 'doing thinking' as a material-speculative practice that re-positions research as a critical open-ended space for non-standard ways of knowing. The paper explores implications of this for ethics and responsibility in computing, materiality of knowledge production and modes of interdisciplinary collaborations.

10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.008,"Over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in K-12 education has flourished. In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities. • Design-based research approach to investigate constructionism-based coding activities for children. • Identify elements of children's engagement in constructionism-based coding activities. • Theoretical grounding of the findings on constructionism theory. • Instructional design principles to facilitate constructionism-based coding activities for children.

In the course of this development computing models have been extended from the initial abstract symbol manipulating mechanisms of stand-alone, discrete sequential machines, to the models of natural computing in the physical world, generally concurrent asynchronous processes capable of modelling living systems, their informational structures and dynamics on both symbolic and sub-symbolic information processing levels. Present account of models of computation highlights several topics of importance for the development of new understanding of computing and its role: natural computation and the relationship between the model and physical implementation, interactivity as fundamental for computational modelling of concurrent information processing systems such as living organisms and their networks, and the new developments in logic needed to support this generalized framework. Computing understood as information processing is closely related to natural sciences; it helps us recognize connections between sciences, and provides a unified approach for modeling and simulating of both living and non-living systems.

10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104424,"Providing high-quality instruction with technology has become more important than ever before. However, the instructional practices and the degree to which key skills, such as digital literacy and computational thinking, are emphasized in classrooms vary considerably between teachers, schools, and countries. The present study was aimed at explaining this variation in the frequency of teaching practices with technology and teachers' emphasis on developing students' computer and information literacy and computational thinking by key aspects of teacher motivation and expertise, school conditions and priorities, and countries' economy and innovation. Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries' economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. Our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors. • Emphasizing digital literacy and computational thinking is key to teaching with ICT. • Teacher motivation and collaboration were linked to ICT teaching across countries. • Principals' expectations explained ICT teaching in Finnish and German schools. • Regression trees supported the importance of motivation, expertise, collaboration. • Countries' GDP and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects.

10.1016/j.rser.2019.06.015,"The energy, water and food (EWF) nexus modelling and analysis frameworks proposed recently have demonstrated their effectiveness in the assessment and quantification of synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between the three sectors. They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates ""algorithmic resilience thinking"" to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions. • A flexible computational framework is proposed to model the interactions between the energy, water and food (EWF) sectors. • Advanced techniques in computational intelligence are utilised for the mathematical representation of EWF resource systems. • An iterative algorithm tracks emerging risks in the EWF nexus, and aids in optimal decision-making for risk mitigation. • A case study considers the impact of weather volatility on outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar.

The study is based on analyses of a video recorded peer group activity in which two children, within the context of a project on computational thinking using the software Scratch, collaboratively work to solve a coding problem. Drawing on work on epistemics-in-interaction and the cooperative and transformative organization of human action and knowledge, the analyses focus on the interactional strategies that the children use to establish, sustain, and develop knowledge within the peer group and the role of affect in the unfolding organization of actions. By analyzing the multimodal cultural production in children's interaction with digital technologies, it is shown how children learn creative and artful skills, thus positioning them as consumers as well as producers of media.

10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.006,"Abstract Despite the growing number of digital apps designed to teach coding skills to young children, we know little about their effectiveness. To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, M age = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move , grow , jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children. Highlights • Children's learning of foundational coding skills via tablet apps was tested. • After one week, children demonstrated learning of game-specific coding skills. • Child gender was not related to learning outcomes. • App appeal was positively related to learning outcomes.

10.1111/jcal.12266,"Abstract: The long‐standing debate into the potential benefit of developing mathematical thinking skills through learning to program has been reignited with the widespread introduction of programming in schools across many countries, including England where it is a statutory requirement for all pupils to be taught programming from 5 years old. Algorithm is introduced early in the English computing curriculum, yet there is limited knowledge of how young pupils view this concept. This paper explores pupils' (aged 10–11) understandings of algorithm following their engagement with 1 year of ScratchMaths, a curriculum designed to develop computational and mathematical thinking skills through learning to program. A total of 181 pupils from 6 schools undertook a set of written tasks to assess their interpretations and evaluations of different algorithms that solve the same problem, with a subset of these pupils subsequently interviewed to probe their understandings in greater depth. We discuss the different approaches identified, the evaluation criteria they used, and the aspects of the concept that pupils found intuitive or challenging, such as simplification and abstraction. The paper ends with some reflections on the implications of the research, concluding with a set of recommendations for pedagogy in developing primary pupils' algorithmic thinking.

10.1109/TE.2018.2804350,"Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students’ learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students’ learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.

10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.018,"Testosterone has been implicated in the regulation of emotional responses and risky decision-making. However, the causal effect of testosterone upon emotional decision-making, especially in non-social settings, is still unclear. The present study investigated the role of testosterone in counterfactual thinking: regret is an intense negative emotion that arises from comparison of an obtained outcome from a decision against a better, non-obtained (i.e. counterfactual) alternative. Healthy male participants (n = 64) received a single-dose of 150 mg testosterone Androgel in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-participants design. At 180 min post-administration, participants performed the counterfactual thinking task. We applied a computational model derived from behavioral economic principles to uncover latent decision-making mechanisms that may be invisible in simple choice analyses. Our data showed that testosterone increased the ability to use anticipated regret to guide choice behavior, while reducing choice based on expected value. On affective ratings, testosterone increased sensitivity to both obtained and counterfactual outcomes. These findings provide evidence that testosterone causally modulates emotional decision-making, and highlight the role of testosterone in affective sensitivity.

This article examines two ways that African-American cultural capital and computing can be bridged in CS education. The first is <italic>community representation,</italic> using cultural capital to highlight students’ social identities and networks through computational thinking. The second, <italic>computational integration,</italic> locates computation in cultural capital itself. I survey two risks - the appearance of shallow computing and the reproduction of assimilationist logics - that may arise when constructing one bridge without the other. To avoid these risks, I introduce the concept of <italic>computational communities</italic> by exploring areas in CS education that employ both strategies. This concept is then grounded in qualitative data from an after school program that connected CS to African-American cosmetology.

10.2505/4/jcst17_046_06_12,"Science education reform documents call for students to learn science by engaging in inquiry and using science practices. One such science practice is constructing evidencebased explanations. Few students enter community college science classrooms having experience with, or being proficient in, using evidence to explain scientific phenomena. Therefore, we used a claim-evidencereasoning framework to scaffold students as they learned to construct evidence-based explanations in an introductory environmental science course at a regional community college. We gathered pre/post and unit tests as well as lab reports to examine students' explanations throughout the course and found strong growth in students' tests scores but very little growth on the lab scores. In addition, we found that students struggled most with the scientific reasoning component of explanations. We discuss the interconnectivity of science practices when engaging in authentic labs. Without knowledge and skill in other science practices, such as finding patterns in data and using mathematics and computational thinking, students will likely struggle with constructing evidence-based explanations. We provide two main recommendations for engaging students in authentic science in the laboratory component of a class.

10.1109/TE.2016.2622680,"Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided—Wearing the Web—in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.

10.1177/0306419016674133,"This paper reports the recent development and implementation of three teaching modules in order to teach and enhance the students' critical thinking skills in a level IV undergraduate/postgraduate course 'Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for Engineering Applications'. These teaching modules include a lecture module, an online test module and a CFD project module. The lecture module introduces the importance of critical thinking skills by an example case, critical thinking definition and processes, and the application of critical thinking skills in formulation of CFD problems. In the online test module, seven online tests have been developed to enhance the students' understanding of the contents of lectures and practical sessions. Meanwhile, students apply their critical thinking skills to work out some of the tests. In the project module, a student-driven CFD project is designed to help students to apply CFD techniques and critical thinking skills in engineering problems. In the project, students choose their own project topic and problems. They use CFD skills learned in the course and critical thinking skills to critically analyse their problems, identify the important parameters and review results. They apply the critical writing skills to finalise a project report. To the best knowledge of the author, this systematical integration of teaching and enhancement of critical thinking skills in computational fluid dynamics course is innovative. Feedback from students is quite positive shown by an anonymous survey in 2014.

10.1016/j.cedpsych.2016.10.003,"This study investigated introductory computer science (CS1) students’ implicit beliefs of intelligence. Referencing Dweck and Leggett’s (1988) framework for implicit beliefs of intelligence, we examined how (1) students’ implicit beliefs changed over the course of a semester, (2) these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profile, and (3) implicit beliefs predicted student learning based on standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test. For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses. Theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for STEM educators are discussed.

10.1016/j.artmed.2022.102458,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has only partially (or not at all) been integrated into medical education, leading to growing concerns regarding how to train healthcare practitioners to handle the changes brought about by the introduction of AI. Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients. • Technical education in the form of Computational thinking goes beyond teaching programming languages, as it focus on the underlying assumptions and limitations that construct technology. • For medical students, teaching students about artificial intelligence (AI) directly in clinical applications is a helpful approach to support their understanding on AI. • To meet the needs of exposing students to AI, there is an opportunity to use scenarios and applications of artificial intelligence as examples for case-based learning. • Case-based learning methodology supports the analysis of practical issues while connecting technical and clinical concepts. • Using case-based learning with examples from scenarios where AI is currently implemented could also train reflective, ethical, and interdisciplinary skills.

Through CCL, young people conceptualize, create, and disseminate digital projects that break silences, expose important truths, and challenge unjust systems, all the while building skills such as coding and design. This empirical study of CCL is based at Youth Radio, a nationally recognized multimedia production company in Oakland, California. Using embedded ethnographic methods, we focus on one collaborative project inside Youth Radio's Interactive department, where young people partnered with adult colleagues to produce a web-based interactive map of gentrification in a West Oakland neighborhood. Findings demonstrate a highly sophisticated knowledge production process where youth are simultaneously contending with content, message, audience, aesthetics, design, functionality, execution, and the long-term ramifications or “digital afterlife” of their work. Through learning environments organized around critical computational literacy, young people emerge as critical problem-solvers unified by the technical know-how and the critical consciousness necessary for them to leverage digital tools for social transformation.

10.1016/j.chb.2016.07.017,"Pair programming (PP) is a usefulness approach to fostering computational thinking (CT) for young students. However, there are many factors to impact the effectiveness of PP. Among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.

This study analyzes the outcomes of a novel, preservice STEM teacher education model. Building on both general and STEM-specific teacher preparation principles, this program combined two traditional mathematics and science methods courses into one STEM block. Analysis compared preservice teachers in the traditional courses with those enrolled in the STEM block, investigating STEM teaching efficacy, reported and exhibited pedagogical practices, and STEM literacies using a pre-post survey as well as analysis of lesson planning products. Linear regression models indicated that substantial growth was seen in both approaches but STEM block preservice teachers reported significantly greater gains in STEM teaching efficacy as compared with traditional-route teachers. Lesson planning artifacts also demonstrated increased facilitation of STEM literacies, with specific attention to content integration, engineering and design, and arts inclusion. Technology and computational thinking emerged as areas for further growth and clarification in STEM teacher education models. Findings contribute to a growing research base on developing the STEM teacher workforce.

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students.

OSSCAR provides an open collaborative environment to develop and access educational resources in the form of web applications, for which various deployment methods are discussed and compared. To minimize efforts in the creation and use of new educational material, OSSCAR combines software tools that have emerged as standards with custom domain-specific ones. The technical solutions adopted to create and distribute content are described and motivated on the basis of reliability, sustainability, ease of uptake and use. Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material.

Advances in computational thinking and data science have led to a new era of artificial intelligence systems being engineered to adapt to complex situations and develop actionable knowledge. These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior.

,"This paper focuses on the current trends in the domain of brain research and on the current stage of development of the research for software and hardware solutions, communication capabilities between human beings and machines, new technologies, nanoscience and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed model for the Human Brain assumes the main similarities between human intelligence and the chess game thinking process. Tactical and strategic reasoning and the need to follow the rules of the chess game are all very similar to the activities of the human brain. The main objective for a living being and the chess game player are the same: securing a position, surviving and eliminating the adversaries. The brain resolves these goals and, moreover, the being's movement, actions and speech are sustained by the vital five senses and equilibrium. The chess game strategy helps us understand the human brain better and to replicate easier in the proposed 'Software and Hardware' SAH Model.

10.1080/08993408.2014.952500,"When learning to program, students often mistakenly refer to an element that is structurally related to the element that they intend to reference. For example, they may indicate the attribute of an object when their intention is to reference the whole object. This paper examines these reference-point errors through the context of metonymy. Metonymy is a rhetorical device where the speaker states a referent that is structurally related to the intended referent. For example, the following sentence states an office bureau but actually refers to a person working at the bureau:The tourist asked the travel bureau for directions to the museum.Drawing upon previous studies, I discuss how student reference errors may be consistent with the use of metonymy. In particular, I hypothesize that students are more likely to reference an identifying element even when a structurally related element is intended. I then present two experiments, which produce results consistent with this analysis. In both experiments, students are more likely to produce reference-point errors that involve identifying attributes than descriptive attributes. Given these results, I explore the possibility that students are relying on habits of communication rather than the mechanistic principles needed for successful programming. Finally I discuss teaching interventions using live examples and how metonymy may be presented to non-computing students as pedagogy for computational thinking.

10.1016/j.patcog.2013.09.032,"Abstract: Several automation tools have been developed over the years for forensic document examination (FDE) of handwritten items. Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. The task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.

10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101183,"According to modern notions, computing is not separable from cognitive modeling and activity. This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion. • Cognitive system reflects interaction of computational processes. • Computational framework is based on theory of combinators. • Setting up computing invariants. • Processes of bi-directional object conversion. • Synthesis of objects with given combinatory characteristic. • Modeling the plurality of the worlds of combinators.

10.1016/j.beproc.2012.02.008,"Abstract: The merging of the computational theory of mind and evolutionary thinking leads to a kind of rationalism, in which enduring truths about the world have become implicit in the computations that enable the brain to cope with the experienced world. The dead reckoning computation, for example, is implemented within the brains of animals as one of the mechanisms that enables them to learn where they are (). It integrates a velocity signal with respect to a time signal. Thus, the manner in which position and velocity relate to one another in the world is reflected in the manner in which signals representing those variables are processed in the brain. I use principles of information theory and Bayesian inference to derive from other simple principles explanations for: (1) the failure of partial reinforcement to increase reinforcements to acquisition; (2) the partial reinforcement extinction effect; (3) spontaneous recovery; (4) renewal; (5) reinstatement; (6) resurgence (aka facilitated reacquisition). Like the principle underlying dead-reckoning, these principles are grounded in analytic considerations. They are the kind of enduring truths about the world that are likely to have shaped the brain''s computations.

However, as the amount of data increases, the multi-granularity knowledge space will have a larger number of layers, which will reduce its problem-solving ability. Therefore, we define a knowledge space distance measurement and propose two algorithms to select k representative layers from the multi-granularity knowledge space, where k is specified by the user according to the needs in problem solving, and k representative layers are approximately equidistant. First, we propose a knowledge space distance to measure the distance between any two layers in a multi-granularity knowledge space with superset-subset relationships, and the rationality of the knowledge space distance is verified by theory and experiment. Second, relying on the knowledge space distance and knowledge space distance variance, we propose two algorithms (i.e., a deterministic algorithm and a heuristic algorithm) to select an approximate equidistant k -layer multi-granularity knowledge space. Third, in addition to verifying the effectiveness of the knowledge space distance, the knowledge space distance variance, the deterministic algorithm and the heuristic algorithm, we verify that the equidistant k -layer multi-granularity knowledge space is more efficient than the original multi-granularity knowledge space.

10.1002/hbe2.220,"The role of technology in STEM education remains unclear and needs stronger operational definition. In this paper, we explore the theoretical connection between STEM and emergent technologies, with a focus on learner behaviors and the potential of technology‐mediated experiences with computational participation (CP) in shaping STEM learning. In particular, by de‐emphasizing what technology is used and bringing renewed focus to how the technology is used, we make a case for CP as an epistemological and pedagogical approach that promotes collaborative STEM practices. Utilizing Ihde's work as a conceptual framework, we explore how technology‐mediated relations shape STEM learner experiences and behaviors by empowering learners to develop scientific knowledge through collaborative participation and interactive relationships with technology. In particular, we focus on technology mediated game‐based learning and citizen science, and examine how CP creates opportunities for STEM learners to leverage learning with technology in innovative ways. We argue that through computational and collaborative learning experiences, learners participate as members of STEM learning communities in ways that mirror how STEM professionals collaborate, applying interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to complex real‐world problems. Computational participation consequently creates opportunities for learner‐technology pairings to (re)shape STEM learning behaviors, empowering learners to engage collaboratively as members of a STEM community of practice.

10.3390/biology10060506,"Simple Summary: The rapid increase in technology in recent years has created the need to apply different methods in education. Teaching lessons with technology-based activities rather than the traditional teaching method is an obligation for teachers. For this reason, teachers need resources whose validity and reliability are tested that they can use in their lessons. In this study, a part of the technology content resource that teachers need for a biology lesson is presented. While preparing the course contents, a STEM approach including science, engineering, mathematics and technology disciplines was used. A significant increase was found in the ability of the students to whom the developed activities were applied to establish cause and effect relationships. According to this result, it can be said that Arduino-supported STEM education improves students' abilities to establish cause and effect relationships. Considering that generations that have grown up in the 21st-century have grown alongside technology, it is thought that integrating technology into lessons helps students learn the subject. This study aims to develop five STEM activities for the lesson of the human body systems by integrating the coding-based Arduino into STEM education. The activities were implemented to 6th-grade students for seven weeks and the effects on students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The study method was pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design, and the cause-effect relationship scale and semi-structured view form were used as data collection tools. As a result of the study, a significant difference was found between the Arduino-supported STEM activities developed and the students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The students who received the Arduino-supported STEM education found the course to be entertaining and educational, and the future goals of these students were affected. In order to bring individuals who love their profession into the future, Arduino-supported STEM education should be applied and expanded in other branches and class levels.

These efforts expect a scholarly environment that values the individual student, integrates current trends from the primary literature to provide essential fundamentals in the discipline and experimentally‐directed research, collection and analysis of data and scientific writing. Current trends in the discipline dictate these efforts must necessarily include critical thinking, experimental‐testing, computational‐modeling and inferential logic. In essence, modern biochemistry and molecular biology education must informed by, and integrated with cutting edge research. This environment relies on internal and external research support, commitment by members of the faculty to provide the requisite mentoring, access to instrumentation and state‐of‐the art facilities. New academic environments and resource centers must be provided to establish a culture of pedagogical excellence and faculty engagement leading to innovation in the classroom and laboratory through teamwork and active learning. These efforts must not lose sight of the importance of multidimensional programs that enrich science literacy in all facets of the population, including the general public, students and teachers in K‐12 schools, non‐biochemistry and molecular biology students and other stakeholders. As biochemistry and molecular biology educators, there is an obligation to provide students will the skills that allows them to be innovative and self‐reliant.

10.1016/j.jmathb.2020.100783,"• Combinatorial topics offer opportunities for students to engage in rich mathematical thinking and foster desirable practices. • However, combinatorics has largely been removed from K-16 curricula in the United States. • Our field should build on combinatorics education literature to study the value of including combinatorics in K-16 curricula. In this commentary, we make a case for the explicit inclusion of combinatorial topics in mathematics curricula, where it is currently essentially absent. We suggest ways in which researchers might inform the field's understanding of combinatorics and its potential role in curricula. We reflect on five decades of research that has been conducted since a call by Kapur (1970) for a greater focus on combinatorics in mathematics education. Specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) Combinatorics is accessible, 2) Combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) Combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) Combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) Combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity. Ultimately, we make a case for the valuable and unique ways in which combinatorics might effectively be leveraged within K-16 curricula.

10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103898,"There is an increasing emphasis on teaching young learners to code; yet, there are few tools designed to measure the effect of learning to code on children. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value , coding confidence , coding interest , perception of coders , and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value , which in turn influenced coding interest , perception of coders , and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value , which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners' attitudes toward coding over time. • The Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey assesses children's coding attitudes. • CFA confirmed five factors: social value, confidence, interest, utility, perception of coders. • In SEM, social value was the prime predictor of outcomes. • Also significant: grade level, coding frequency and experience, math interest and confidence.

10.1259/bjr.20190304,"Treatment planning is the process where the prescription of the radiation oncologist is translated into a deliverable treatment. With the complexity of contemporary radiotherapy, treatment planning cannot be performed without a computerized treatment planning system. Proton therapy (PT) enables highly conformal treatment plans with a minimum of dose to tissues outside the target volume, but to obtain the most optimal plan for the treatment, there are a multitude of parameters that need to be addressed. In this review areas of ongoing improvements and research in the field of PT treatment planning are identified and discussed. The main focus is on issues of immediate clinical and practical relevance to the PT community highlighting the needs for the near future but also in a longer perspective. We anticipate that the manual tasks performed by treatment planners in the future will involve a high degree of computational thinking, as many issues can be solved much better by e.g. scripting. More accurate and faster dose calculation algorithms are needed, automation for contouring and planning is required and practical tools to handle the variable biological efficiency in PT is urgently demanded just to mention a few of the expected improvements over the coming 10 years.

10.1111/csp2.44,"As conservation shifts to meet the challenges of our globalized world, approaches for planning and evaluating interventions must evolve to account for the increasing complexity of conservation problems and the dynamic, multiscalar relationships between humans and the environment. Systems thinking offers approaches that could help conservation be more adaptive, transparent, and evidence‐based. Using case studies and the literature, we trace the evolution of systems thinking and demonstrate how systems mapping could support the process of planning and evaluating interventions. Systems mapping helps disentangle the context of conservation and encourage collaborative planning that integrates diverse views. It can also change the way interventions are characterized and communicated by emphasizing the systems targeted for change as opposed to actions. Last, it can encourage evidence‐based decision‐making by identifying indicators attune to complexity, prompting discussion on knowledge gaps, and filling gaps through qualitative mapping or computational modeling. Integrating systems thinking in practice will help practitioners foster the capacity for learning and adaptation required for conservation to deliver global results.

10.1177/1461444815624182,"This article examines the articulation of computational journalism, focusing on how the meaning of the computational is discursively constructed and mobilized as a specific constellation of intelligibility within news organizations. Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age.

10.1371/journal.pbio.3002834,"Dengue virus (DENV) is currently causing epidemics of unprecedented scope in endemic settings and expanding to new geographical areas. It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here, we propose adding 2 sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national, and subnational discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance. Information about our lineage system, including methods to assign lineages to sequence data and propose new lineages, can be found at: dengue-lineages.org.

10.1038/s41598-024-70183-2,"Staphylococci are responsible for a wide range of infections in animals. The most common species infecting animals include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus intermedius. Recent increases in antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in animals highlight the need to understand the potential role of commercial livestock as a reservoir of staphylococci and antibiotic resistance genes. Nasal swabs were collected from 143 apparently healthy pigs and 21 pig farm workers, and 45 environmental swabs of feed and water troughs, from two commercial pig farms in the Western Cape, South Africa. Staphylococci were isolated, identified using mass-spectrometry, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and Illumina whole genome sequencing were performed. One hundred and eighty-five (185) Staphylococcus spp. isolates were obtained, with Mammalicoccus sciuri (n = 57; 31%) being the most common, followed by S. hyicus (n = 40; 22%) and S. aureus (n = 29; 16%). S. epidermidis was predominantly identified in the farm workers (n = 18; 86%). Tetracycline resistance was observed across all species, with rates ranging from 67 to 100%. Majority of M. sciuri isolates (n = 40; 70%) were methicillin resistant, with 78% (n = 31) harbouring mecA. M. sciuri isolates had genes/elements which were associated with SCCmec_type_III (3A) and SCCmec_type_VIII(4A) and were mostly observed in ST61 strains. ST239 strains were associated with SCCmec_type_III(3A). High rates of tetracycline resistance were identified among staphylococci in the pig farms in Western Cape, South Africa.

10.1186/s12879-024-09579-4,"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that HIV treatment scale-up is accompanied by a robust assessment of drug resistance emergence and transmission. The WHO HIV Drug Resistance (HIVDR) monitoring and surveillance strategy includes HIVDR testing in adults both initiating and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Due to limited information about HIVDR in Mozambique, we conducted two nationally representative surveys of adults initiating and receiving first-line ART regimes to better inform the HIV program. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study between March 2017 and December 2019. Adults (older than 15 years) living with HIV (PLHIV) initiating ART or receiving first-line ART for between 9-15 months at 25 health facilities across all eleven provinces in Mozambique were included. Genotypic HIVDR was assessed on dried blood spots (DBS) when viral loads were ≥ 1000 copies/ml. Genotypic resistance for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) was determined using the Stanford HIV database algorithm 9.5 and calibrated population resistance tool 8.1. Results: Of 828 participants -enrolled, viral load (VL) testing was performed on 408 initiators and 409 ART experienced. Unsuppressed VL was found in 68.1% 419 initiators and 18.8% (77/409) of the ART experienced. Of the 278 initiators and 70 ART experienced who underwent sequencing, 51.7% (144/278) and 75.7% (53/70) were sequenced successfully. Among the new initiators, pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) for NNRTI and PI was found in 16.0% (23/144) and 1.4% (2/144) of the participants, respectively. Acquired drug resistance (ADR) was found in 56.5% (30/53) of the ART-experienced participants of whom 24.5% (13/53) were resistant to both NRTI and NNRTI. Conclusion: High rates of PDR and ADR for NNRTI and ADR for NRTI were observed in our study. These findings support the replacement of NNRTIs with dolutegravir (DTG) but high levels of NRTI resistance in highly treatment-experienced individuals still require attention when transitioning to new regimens. Moreover, the study underlines the need for routine VL testing and HIVDR surveillance to improve treatment management strategies.

10.1038/s41598-024-66625-6,"The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm for Near-term Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers (NISQ) providing approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The QAOA utilizes a quantum-classical loop, consisting of a quantum ansatz and a classical optimizer, to minimize some cost function, computed on the quantum device. This paper presents an investigation into the impact of realistic noise on the classical optimizer and the determination of optimal circuit depth for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the presence of noise. We find that, while there is no significant difference in the performance of classical optimizers in a state vector simulation, the Adam and AMSGrad optimizers perform best in the presence of shot noise. Under the conditions of real noise, the SPSA optimizer, along with ADAM and AMSGrad, emerge as the top performers. The study also reveals that the quality of solutions to some 5 qubit minimum vertex cover problems increases for up to around six layers in the QAOA circuit, after which it begins to decline. This analysis shows that increasing the number of layers in the QAOA in an attempt to increase accuracy may not work well in a noisy device.

The research involved 1927 participants (83.93% of the total prison population) and utilized nasopharyngeal swabs and RT-qPCR testing for detection. Contact tracing monitored exposure within cells. Out of 2108 samples, 66 positive cases were identified (3.13%), mostly asymptomatic (77.27%), with the majority aged 21–29 and varying vaccination statuses. Next-generation sequencing generated 28 whole genome sequences, identifying the Omicron variant (subtypes BA.2 and BA.5) with 99% average coverage. Additionally, the study seeks to determine the relationship between immunization levels and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases within this enclosed population. The findings underscore the necessity of comprehensive control strategies in prisons, including rigorous screening, isolation protocols, vaccination, epidemiological monitoring, and genomic surveillance to mitigate disease transmission and protect both the incarcerated population and the broader community.

10.1002/jia2.26248,"Introduction: In South Africa, the HIV care cascade remains suboptimal. We investigated the impact of small conditional financial incentives (CFIs) and male‐targeted HIV‐specific decision‐support application (EPIC‐HIV) on the HIV care cascade. Methods: In 2018, in uMkhanyakude district, 45 communities were randomly assigned to one of four arms: (i) CFI for home‐based HIV testing and linkage to care within 6 weeks (R50 [US$3] food voucher each); (ii) EPIC‐HIV which are based on self‐determination theory; (iii) both CFI and EPIC‐HIV; and (iv) standard of care. EPIC‐HIV consisted of two components: EPIC‐HIV 1, provided to men through a tablet before home‐based HIV testing, and EPIC‐HIV 2, offered 1 month later to men who tested positive but had not yet linked to care. Linking HITS trial data to national antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme data and HIV surveillance programme data, we estimated HIV status awareness after the HITS trial implementation, ART status 3 month after the trial and viral load suppression 1 year later. Analysis included all known individuals living with HIV in the study area including those who did not participated in the HITS trial. Results: Among the 33,778 residents in the study area, 2763 men and 7266 women were identified as living with HIV by the end of the intervention period and included in the analysis. After the intervention, awareness of HIV‐positive status was higher in the CFI arms compared to non‐CFI arms (men: 793/908 [87.3%] vs. 1574/1855 [84.9%], RR = 1.03 [95% CI: 0.99−1.07]; women: 2259/2421 [93.3%] vs. 4439/4845 [91.6%], RR = 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00−1.04]). Three months after the intervention, no differences were found for linkage to ART between arms. One year after the intervention, only 1829 viral test results were retrieved. Viral suppression was higher but not significant in the EPIC‐HIV intervention arms among men (65/99 [65.7%] vs. 182/308 [59.1%], RR = 1.11 [95% CI: 0.88−1.40]). Conclusions: Small CFIs can contribute to achieve the first step of the HIV care cascade. However, neither CFIs nor EPIC‐HIV was sufficient to increase the number of people on ART. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the impact of EPIC‐HIV on viral suppression.

10.1038/s41598-024-54598-5,"In recent years, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have been widely used as a test bed for quantum dynamics. This work provides a new hardware-agnostic framework for modelling the Markovian noise and dynamics of quantum systems in benchmark procedures used to evaluate device performance. As an accessible example, the application and performance of this framework is demonstrated on IBM Quantum computers. This framework serves to extract multiple calibration parameters simultaneously through a simplified process which is more reliable than previously studied calibration experiments and tomographic procedures. Additionally, this method allows for real-time calibration of several hardware parameters of a quantum computer within a comprehensive procedure, providing quantitative insight into the performance of each device to be accounted for in future quantum circuits. The framework proposed here has the additional benefit of highlighting the consistency among qubit pairs when extracting parameters, which leads to a less computationally expensive calibration process than evaluating the entire device at once.

10.1080/23311916.2024.2322814,"A drastic decline in the number of students that are enrolled for Engineering is now being experienced in developed as well as developing countries. Learning is becoming boring as a generation brought up on technology is losing the ability to pay attention in traditional classes for a long stretch of time. This has led to the idea that other teaching methods do exist and can be applied in teaching/learning. This work leveraged the use of Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) in Engineering classrooms to develop a serious game named LogicHouse Version 1 (LogicHouse-V1 or LogicHouse for short). The game, is a web-based serious game prototype that targets selected topics in Digital Electronics course. This course is a core component of undergraduate curriculum in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Communication Engineering, Computer Science and other related Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses. LogicHouse involves a virtual broken house where the player has to play the various levels to fix the house and gain points along the way. This game was designed based on the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Furthermore, the design was implemented using Adobe Illustrator, Procreate, Unity Engine, C#, Microsoft Azure Playfab and deployed on itch.io. Preliminary evaluation results indicate that students are interested in the game and its application. Based on this, there is a prospect of improved performance in any course in which the game is implemented.

10.1186/s12889-023-17339-3,"Introduction: Fishing populations constitute a suitable key population amongst which to conduct HIV prevention trials due to very high HIV prevalence and incidence, however, these are highly mobile populations. We determined the feasibility and acceptability of using fingerprinting and geographical positioning systems to describe mobility patterns and retention among fisherfolks on the shoreline of Lake Victoria in South-western Uganda. Methods: Between August 2015 and January 2017, two serial cross-sectional surveys were conducted during which fingerprinting of all residents aged 18–30 years on the shoreline of Lake Victoria was done. A mapper moving ahead of the survey team, produced village maps and took coordinates of every household. These were accessed by the survey team that assigned household and individual unique identifiers (ID) and collected demographic data. Using the assigned IDs, individuals were enrolled and their fingerprints scanned. The fingerprinting was repeated 6 months later in order to determine the participant's current household. If it was different from that at baseline, a new household ID was assigned which was used to map migrations both within and between villages. Results: At both rounds, over 99% accepted to be fingerprinted. No fingerprinting faults were recorded at baseline and the level was under 1% at round two. Over 80% of the participants were seen at round two and of these, 16.3%, had moved to a new location whilst the majority, 85%, stayed within the same village. Movements between villages were mainly observed for those resident in large villages. Those who did not consider a fishing village to be their permanent home were less likely to be migrants than permanent residents (adjusted odds ratio = 0.37, 95%CI:0.15–0.94). Conclusion: Use of fingerprinting in fishing populations is feasible and acceptable. It is possible to track this mobile population for clinical trials or health services using this technology since most movements could be traced within and between villages.

10.1186/s12889-023-17092-7,"Background: Most COVID-19 vulnerability indices rely on measures that are biased by rates of exposure or are retrospective like mortality rates that offer little opportunity for intervention. The Moore-Hill Vulnerability Index (MHVI) is a precision public health early warning alternative to traditional infection fatality rates that presents avenues for mortality prevention. Methods: We produced an infection-severity vulnerability index by calculating the proportion of all recorded positive cases that were severe and attended by ambulances at small area scale for the East Midlands of the UK between May 2020 and April 2022. We produced maps identifying regions with high and low vulnerability, investigated the accuracy of the index over shorter and longer time periods, and explored the utility of the MHVI compared to other common proxy measures and indices. Analysis included exploring the correlation between our novel index and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Results: The MHVI captures geospatial dynamics that single metrics alone often overlook, including the compound health challenges associated with disadvantaged and declining coastal towns inhabited by communities with post-industrial health legacies. A moderate negative correlation between MHVI and IMD reflects spatial analysis which suggests that high vulnerability occurs in affluent rural as well as deprived coastal and urban communities. Further, the MHVI estimates of severity rates are comparable to infection fatality rates for COVID-19. Conclusions: The MHVI identifies regions with known high rates of poor health outcomes prior to the pandemic that case rates or mortality rates alone fail to identify. Pre-hospital early warning measures could be utilised to prevent mortality during a novel pandemic.

10.1111/irv.13198,"Background: In Angola, COVID‐19 cases have been reported in all provinces, resulting in >105,000 cases and >1900 deaths. However, no detailed genomic surveillance into the introduction and spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has been conducted in Angola. We aimed to investigate the emergence and epidemic progression during the peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Angola. Methods: We generated 1210 whole‐genome SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences, contributing West African data to the global context, that were phylogenetically compared against global strains. Virus movement events were inferred using ancestral state reconstruction. Results: The epidemic in Angola was marked by four distinct waves of infection, dominated by 12 virus lineages, including VOCs, VOIs, and the VUM C.16, which was unique to South‐Western Africa and circulated for an extended period within the region. Virus exchanges occurred between Angola and its neighboring countries, and strong links with Brazil and Portugal reflected the historical and cultural ties shared between these countries. The first case likely originated from southern Africa. Conclusion: A lack of a robust genome surveillance network and strong dependence on out‐of‐country sequencing limit real‐time data generation to achieve timely disease outbreak responses, which remains of the utmost importance to mitigate future disease outbreaks in Angola.

10.1002/jia2.26142,"Introduction: While it is widely acknowledged that family relationships can influence health outcomes, their impact on the uptake of individual health interventions is unclear. In this study, we quantified how the efficacy of a randomized health intervention is shaped by its pattern of distribution in the family network. Methods: The ""Home‐Based Intervention to Test and Start"" (HITS) was a 2×2 factorial community‐randomized controlled trial in Umkhanyakude, KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa, embedded in the Africa Health Research Institute's population‐based demographic and HIV surveillance platform (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT03757104). The study investigated the impact of two interventions: a financial micro‐incentive and a male‐targeted HIV‐specific decision support programme. The surveillance area was divided into 45 community clusters. Individuals aged ≥15 years in 16 randomly selected communities were offered a micro‐incentive (R50 [$3] food voucher) for rapid HIV testing (intervention arm). Those living in the remaining 29 communities were offered testing only (control arm). Study data were collected between February and November 2018. Using routinely collected data on parents, conjugal partners, and co‐residents, a socio‐centric family network was constructed among HITS‐eligible individuals. Nodes in this network represent individuals and ties represent family relationships. We estimated the effect of offering the incentive to people with and without family members who also received the offer on the uptake of HIV testing. We fitted a linear probability model with robust standard errors, accounting for clustering at the community level. Results: Overall, 15,675 people participated in the HITS trial. Among those with no family members who received the offer, the incentive's efficacy was a 6.5 percentage point increase (95% CI: 5.3−7.7). The efficacy was higher among those with at least one family member who received the offer (21.1 percentage point increase (95% CI: 19.9−22.3). The difference in efficacy was statistically significant (21.1–6.5 = 14.6%; 95% CI: 9.3−19.9). Conclusions: Micro‐incentives appear to have synergistic effects when distributed within family networks. These effects support family network‐based approaches for the design of health interventions.

10.1111/joss.12835,"Sensory methodologies are continuously being optimized based on industry needs. Sorting is a widely used sensory method; however, it provides limited information about the uniqueness of individual products. The present work was performed on nine single‐hop beers using a combination of sorting with profiling and intensity rating (SPIR) rating to highlight the intra‐group variability and individual characteristics. Results have shown that SPIR can effectively highlight the intra‐group differences. It has also shown that a higher frequency of citation did not always correspond to a higher attribute intensity. For the considered application, the results highlighted the role of hop varieties on the sensory profile of beers. Overall sensory similarities were found between Mosaic (MO), Citra (CI), and Celeia (CE) hops. However, the use of SPIR highlighted differences between CE and the other hops. Amarillo (AM) hops showed the most distinctive profile in all cases. Practical applications: The use of sorting in combination with profiling and intensity rating (SPIR) rating can be a valuable tool in new product development. It is not only important to understand the overall sensory similarities and differences between groups of samples, but also unique aspects compared to similar products. The present work has shown that adding intensity to sorting and profiling can highlight the inner characteristics of individual products in a group of samples with an overall similar sensory profile.

10.1126/science.adg6605,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) now arise in the context of heterogeneous human connectivity and population immunity. Through a large-scale phylodynamic analysis of 115,622 Omicron BA.1 genomes, we identified >6,000 introductions of the antigenically distinct VOC into England and analyzed their local transmission and dispersal history. We find that six of the eight largest English Omicron lineages were already transmitting when Omicron was first reported in southern Africa (22 November 2021). Multiple datasets show that importation of Omicron continued despite subsequent restrictions on travel from southern Africa as a result of export from well-connected secondary locations. Initiation and dispersal of Omicron transmission lineages in England was a two-stage process that can be explained by models of the countryÕs human geography and hierarchical travel network. Our results enable a comparison of the processes that drive the invasion of Omicron and other VOCs across multiple spatial scales.

This understanding is crucial for assessing threats to these systems and leveraging their biotechnological applications. Given that temporal dynamics are linked to community functioning, this study investigated the drivers of community succession in the wine yeast community. We experimentally generated population dynamics data and used it to create an interpretable model with a gradient boosted regression tree approach. The model was trained on temporal data of viable species populations in various combinations, including pairs, triplets, and quadruplets, and was evaluated for predictive accuracy and input feature importance. Key findings revealed that the inoculation dosage of non- Saccharomyces species significantly influences their performance in mixed cultures, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae consistently dominates regardless of initial abundance. Additionally, we observed multispecies interactions where the dynamics of Wickerhamomyces anomalus were influenced by Torulaspora delbrueckii in pairwise cultures, but this interaction was altered by the inclusion of S. cerevisiae. This study provides insights into yeast community succession and offers valuable machine learning-based analysis techniques applicable to other microbial communities, opening new avenues for harnessing microbial communities.

10.3390/genes15070876,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number and types of dashboards produced increased to convey complex information using digestible visualizations. The pandemic saw a notable increase in genomic surveillance data, which genomic epidemiology dashboards presented in an easily interpretable manner. These dashboards have the potential to increase the transparency between the scientists producing pathogen genomic data and policymakers, public health stakeholders, and the public. This scoping review discusses the data presented, functional and visual features, and the computational architecture of six publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology dashboards. We found three main types of genomic epidemiology dashboards: phylogenetic, genomic surveillance, and mutational. We found that data were sourced from different databases, such as GISAID, GenBank, and specific country databases, and these dashboards were produced for specific geographic locations. The key performance indicators and visualization used were specific to the type of genomic epidemiology dashboard. The computational architecture of the dashboards was created according to the needs of the end user. The genomic surveillance of pathogens is set to become a more common tool used to track ongoing and future outbreaks, and genomic epidemiology dashboards are powerful and adaptable resources that can be used in the public health response.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011194,"Morphometric analysis of wings has been suggested for identifying and controlling isolated populations of tsetse (Glossina spp), vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa. Single-wing images were captured from an extensive data set of field-collected tsetse wings of species Glossina pallidipes and G. m. morsitans. Morphometric analysis required locating 11 anatomical landmarks on each wing. The manual location of landmarks is time-consuming, prone to error, and infeasible for large data sets. We developed a two-tier method using deep learning architectures to classify images and make accurate landmark predictions. The first tier used a classification convolutional neural network to remove most wings that were missing landmarks. The second tier provided landmark coordinates for the remaining wings. We compared direct coordinate regression using a convolutional neural network and segmentation using a fully convolutional network for the second tier. For the resulting landmark predictions, we evaluate shape bias using Procrustes analysis. We pay particular attention to consistent labelling to improve model performance. For an image size of 1024 × 1280, data augmentation reduced the mean pixel distance error from 8.3 (95% confidence interval [4.4,10.3]) to 5.34 (95% confidence interval [3.0,7.0]) for the regression model. For the segmentation model, data augmentation did not alter the mean pixel distance error of 3.43 (95% confidence interval [1.9,4.4]). Segmentation had a higher computational complexity and some large outliers. Both models showed minimal shape bias. We deployed the regression model on the complete unannotated data consisting of 14,354 pairs of wing images since this model had a lower computational cost and more stable predictions than the segmentation model. The resulting landmark data set was provided for future morphometric analysis. The methods we have developed could provide a starting point to studying the wings of other insect species. All the code used in this study has been written in Python and open sourced. Author summary: Tsetse flies, vectors of human and livestock disease, cost African countries billions of dollars annually. Wing shape can be used to identify isolated tsetse populations for suppression. The shape can be captured from digital images by locating anatomical points termed landmarks on the wings. Manual positioning of landmarks is prone to error and only feasible for small data sets. We analyse 14,354 wings and have developed a novel method for automatically positioning landmarks on insect wings. We use a two-step approach, first removing wings that are missing landmarks due to damage. We thereby provide accurate landmarks, unbiased for wing shape. We compared two modern deep-learning models to locate landmarks and showed how data manipulation techniques improve performance. We deployed the final system to generate the landmark data for the tsetse wing images and provide the trained models for transfer learning on similar tasks with smaller data sets. Our methods will allow researchers to study tsetse wing shape in relation to other biological data and to gauge how wing shape characterises tsetse populations. Our method could provide a starting point to the study of the wings of other insect species.

10.1007/s11128-023-04020-2,"Finding solutions to systems of linear equations is a common problem in many areas of science and engineering, with much potential for a speed up on quantum devices. While the Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm yields up to an exponential speed up over classical algorithms in some cases, it requires a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is unlikely to be available in the near-term. Thus, attention has turned to the investigation of quantum algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where several near-term approaches to solving systems of linear equations have been proposed. This paper focuses on the Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS), and other closely related methods and adaptions. Several contributions are made in this paper, which include: the first application of the Evolutionary Ansatz to the VQLS (EAVQLS), the first implementation of the Logical Ansatz VQLS (LAVQLS), based on the Classical Combination of Quantum States (CQS) method, a proof of principle demonstration of the CQS method on real quantum hardware and a method for the implementation of the Adiabatic Ansatz on the VQLS (AAVQLS). These approaches are implemented and contrasted. The CQS method is run with moderate success on a real quantum device. The EAVQLS and AAVQLS show promise as possible improvements to the standard VQLS algorithm once refined.

10.1371/journal.pone.0286373,"Intra-host diversity studies are used to characterise the mutational heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in order to understand the impact of virus-host adaptations. This study investigated the frequency and diversity of the spike (S) protein mutations within SARS-CoV-2 infected South African individuals. The study included SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples, from individuals of all ages, received at the National Health Laboratory Service at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital, Gauteng, South Africa, from June 2020 to May 2022. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays and whole genome sequencing were performed on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The allele frequency (AF) was determined using TaqMan Genotyper software for SNP PCR analysis and galaxy.eu for analysis of FASTQ reads from sequencing. The SNP assays identified 5.3% (50/948) of Delta cases with heterogeneity at delY144 (4%; 2/50), E484Q (6%; 3/50), N501Y (2%; 1/50) and P681H (88%; 44/50), however only heterogeneity for E484Q and delY144 were confirmed by sequencing. From sequencing we identified 9% (210/2381) of cases with Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, BA.2.15, and BA.4 lineages that had heterogeneity in the S protein. Heterogeneity was primarily identified at positions 19 (1.4%) with T19IR (AF 0.2–0.7), 371 (92.3%) with S371FP (AF 0.1–1.0), and 484 (1.9%) with E484AK (0.2–0.7), E484AQ (AF 0.4–0.5) and E484KQ (AF 0.1–0.4). Mutations at heterozygous amino acid positions 19, 371 and 484 are known antibody escape mutations, however the impact of the combination of multiple substitutions identified at the same position is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesise that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with heterogeneity in the S protein facilitate competitive advantage of variants that can completely/partially evade host's natural and vaccine-induced immune responses.

10.3390/v15051194,"SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variants of concern (VOC) have gained more efficient transmission and immune evasion properties with time. We describe the circulation of VOCs in South Africa and the potential role of low-frequency lineages on the emergence of future lineages. Whole genome sequencing was performed on SARS-CoV-2 samples from South Africa. Sequences were analysed with Nextstrain pangolin tools and Stanford University Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database. In 2020, 24 lineages were detected, with B.1 (3%; 8/278), B.1.1 (16%; 45/278), B.1.1.348 (3%; 8/278), B.1.1.52 (5%; 13/278), C.1 (13%; 37/278) and C.2 (2%; 6/278) circulating during the first wave. Beta emerged late in 2020, dominating the second wave of infection. B.1 and B.1.1 continued to circulate at low frequencies in 2021 and B.1.1 re-emerged in 2022. Beta was outcompeted by Delta in 2021, which was thereafter outcompeted by Omicron sub-lineages during the 4th and 5th waves in 2022. Several significant mutations identified in VOCs were also detected in low-frequency lineages, including S68F (E protein); I82T (M protein); P13L, R203K and G204R/K (N protein); R126S (ORF3a); P323L (RdRp); and N501Y, E484K, D614G, H655Y and N679K (S protein). Low-frequency variants, together with VOCs circulating, may lead to convergence and the emergence of future lineages that may increase transmissibility, infectivity and escape vaccine-induced or natural host immunity.

10.1371/journal.pone.0283219,"The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has increased the demand for scalable sequencing and diagnostic methods, especially for genomic surveillance. Although next-generation sequencing has enabled large-scale genomic surveillance, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 in some settings has been limited by the cost of sequencing kits and the time-consuming preparations of sequencing libraries. We compared the sequencing outcomes, cost and turn-around times obtained using the standard Illumina DNA Prep kit protocol to three modified protocols with fewer clean-up steps and different reagent volumes (full volume, half volume, one-tenth volume). We processed a single run of 47 samples under each protocol and compared the yield and mean sequence coverage. The sequencing success rate and quality for the four different reactions were as follows: the full reaction was 98.2%, the one-tenth reaction was 98.0%, the full rapid reaction was 97.5% and the half-reaction, was 97.1%. As a result, uniformity of sequence quality indicated that libraries were not affected by the change in protocol. The cost of sequencing was reduced approximately seven-fold and the time taken to prepare the library was reduced from 6.5 hours to 3 hours. The sequencing results obtained using the miniaturised volumes showed comparability to the results obtained using full volumes as described by the manufacturer. The adaptation of the protocol represents a lower-cost, streamlined approach for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, which can be used to produce genomic data quickly and more affordably, especially in resource-constrained settings.

10.1007/s11128-023-03869-7,"The theory of quantum algorithms promises unprecedented benefits of harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics for solving certain computational problems. A prerequisite for applying quantum algorithms to a wide range of real-world problems is loading classical data to a quantum state. Several circuit-based methods have been proposed for encoding classical data as probability amplitudes of a quantum state. However, in these methods, either quantum circuit depth or width must grow linearly with the data size, nullifying the advantage of representing exponentially many classical data in a quantum state. In this paper, we present a configurable bidirectional procedure that addresses this problem by tailoring the resource trade-off between quantum circuit width and depth. In particular, we show a configuration that encodes an N-dimensional classical data using a quantum circuit whose width and depth both grow sublinearly with N. We demonstrate proof-of-principle implementations on five quantum computers accessed through the IBM and IonQ quantum cloud services.

10.4102/ajlm.v12i1.1975,"Background: Rifampicin resistance missed by commercial rapid molecular assays but detected by phenotypic assays may lead to discordant susceptibility results and affect patient management. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the causes of rifampicin resistance missed by the GenoType MTBDR plus and its impact on the programmatic management of tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: We analysed routine tuberculosis programme data from January 2014 to December 2014 on isolates showing rifampicin susceptibility on the GenoType MTBDR plus assay but resistance on the phenotypic agar proportion method. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of these isolates. Results: Out of 505 patients with isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis on the MTBDR plus , 145 (28.7%) isolates showed both isoniazid and rifampicin resistance on the phenotypic assay. The mean time from MTBDR plus results to initiation of drug-resistant tuberculosis therapy was 93.7 days. 65.7% of the patients had received previous tuberculosis treatment. The most common mutations detected in the 36 sequenced isolates were I491F (16; 44.4%) and L452P (12; 33.3%). Among the 36 isolates, resistance to other anti-tuberculosis drugs was 69.4% for pyrazinamide, 83.3% for ethambutol, 69.4% for streptomycin, and 50% for ethionamide. Conclusion: Missed rifampicin resistance was mostly due to the I491F mutation located outside the MTBDR plus detection area and the L452P mutation, which was not included in the initial version 2 of the MTBDR plus. This led to substantial delays in the initiation of appropriate therapy. The previous tuberculosis treatment history and the high level of resistance to other anti-tuberculosis drugs suggest an accumulation of resistance.

10.1093/femsec/fiae071,"In polar regions, global warming has accelerated the melting of glacial and buried ice, resulting in meltwater run-off and the mobilization of surface nutrients. Yet, the short-term effects of altered nutrient regimes on the diversity and function of soil microbiota in polyextreme environments such as Antarctica, remains poorly understood. We studied these effects by constructing soil microcosms simulating augmented carbon, nitrogen, and moisture. Addition of nitrogen significantly decreased the diversity of Antarctic soil microbial assemblages, compared with other treatments. Other treatments led to a shift in the relative abundances of these microbial assemblages although the distributional patterns were random. Only nitrogen treatment appeared to lead to distinct community structural patterns, with increases in abundance of Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobateria) and a decrease in Verrucomicrobiota (Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobiae).The effects of extracellular enzyme activities and soil parameters on changes in microbial taxa were also significant following nitrogen addition. Structural equation modeling revealed that nutrient source and extracellular enzyme activities were positive predictors of microbial diversity. Our study highlights the effect of nitrogen addition on Antarctic soil microorganisms, supporting evidence of microbial resilience to nutrient increases. In contrast with studies suggesting that these communities may be resistant to change, Antarctic soil microbiota responded rapidly to augmented nutrient regimes.

10.1038/s41598-022-21321-1,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has added new urgency to the study of viral mechanisms of infection. But while vaccines offer a measure of protection against this specific outbreak, a new era of pandemics has been predicted. In addition to this, COVID-19 has drawn attention to post-viral syndromes and the healthcare burden they entail. It seems integral that knowledge of viral mechanisms is increased through as wide a research field as possible. To this end we propose that quantum biology might offer essential new insights into the problem, especially with regards to the important first step of virus-host invasion. Research in quantum biology often centres around energy or charge transfer. While this is predominantly in the context of photosynthesis there has also been some suggestion that cellular receptors such as olfactory or neural receptors might employ vibration assisted electron tunnelling to augment the lock-and-key mechanism. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme function. Enzymes are implicated in the invasion of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Receptors such as olfactory receptors also appear to be disrupted by COVID-19. Building on these observations we investigate the evidence that quantum tunnelling might be important in the context of infection with SARS-CoV-2. We illustrate this with a simple model relating the vibronic mode of, for example, a viral spike protein to the likelihood of charge transfer in an idealised receptor. Our results show a distinct parameter regime in which the vibronic mode of the spike protein enhances electron transfer. With this in mind, novel therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission could potentially be identified by their vibrational spectra.

10.3390/v14091992,"HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) can become a public health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries where genotypic testing for people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not available. For first-line regimens to remain effective, levels of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) need to be monitored over time. To determine the temporal trends of TDR in Mozambique, a search for studies in PubMed and sequences in GenBank was performed. Only studies covering the pol region that described HIVDR and genetic diversity from treatment naïve patients were included. A dataset from seven published studies and one novel unpublished study conducted between 1999 and 2018 were included. The Calibrated Population Resistance tool (CPR) and REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool version 3 for sequences pooled by sampling year were used to determine resistance mutations and subtypes, respectively. The prevalence of HIVDR amongst treatment-naïve individuals increased over time, reaching 14.4% in 2018. The increase was most prominent for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), reaching 12.7% in 2018. Subtype C was predominant in all regions, but a higher genetic variability (19% non-subtype C) was observed in the north region of Mozambique. These findings confirm a higher diversity of HIV in the north of the country and an increased prevalence of NNRTI resistance among treatment naïve individuals over time.

10.3390/v14091878,"COVID-19 was first diagnosed in Egypt on 14 February 2020. By the end of November 2021, over 333,840 cases and 18,832 deaths had been reported. As part of the national genomic surveillance, 1027 SARS-CoV-2 near whole-genomes were generated and published by the end of July 2021. Here we describe the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt over this period using a subset of 976 high-quality Egyptian genomes analyzed together with a representative set of global sequences within a phylogenetic framework. A single lineage, C.36, introduced early in the pandemic was responsible for most of the cases in Egypt. Furthermore, to remain dominant in the face of mounting immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, this lineage acquired several mutations known to confer an adaptive advantage. These results highlight the value of continuous genomic surveillance in regions where VOCs are not predominant and the need for enforcement of public health measures to prevent expansion of the existing lineages.

10.1186/s12933-022-01579-5,"Background: Fibrin(ogen) amyloid microclots and platelet hyperactivation previously reported as a novel finding in South African patients with the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), might form a suitable set of foci for the clinical treatment of the symptoms of Long COVID/PASC. A Long COVID/PASC Registry was subsequently established as an online platform where patients can report Long COVID/PASC symptoms and previous comorbidities. Methods: In this study, we report on the comorbidities and persistent symptoms, using data obtained from 845 South African Long COVID/PASC patients. By using a previously published scoring system for fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology, we also analysed blood samples from 80 patients, and report the presence of significant fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology in all cases. Results: Hypertension, high cholesterol levels (dyslipidaemia), cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were found to be the most important comorbidities. The gender balance (70% female) and the most commonly reported Long COVID/PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, loss of concentration and forgetfulness, shortness of breath, as well as joint and muscle pains) were comparable to those reported elsewhere. These findings confirmed that our sample was not atypical. Microclot and platelet pathologies were associated with Long COVID/PASC symptoms that persisted after the recovery from acute COVID-19. Conclusions: Fibrin amyloid microclots that block capillaries and inhibit the transport of O2 to tissues, accompanied by platelet hyperactivation, provide a ready explanation for the symptoms of Long COVID/PASC. Removal and reversal of these underlying endotheliopathies provide an important treatment option that urgently warrants controlled clinical studies to determine efficacy in patients with a diversity of comorbidities impacting on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We suggest that our platelet and clotting grading system provides a simple and cost-effective diagnostic method for early detection of Long COVID/PASC as a major determinant of effective treatment, including those focusing on reducing clot burden and platelet hyperactivation.

10.1186/s12864-022-08764-6,"Genetic evolution of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Africa has been shaped mainly by environmental changes such as abnormal rainfall patterns and climate change that has occurred over the last few decades. These gradual environmental changes are believed to have effected gene migration from macro (geographical) to micro (reassortment) levels. Presently, 15 lineages of RVFV have been identified to be circulating within the Sub-Saharan Africa. International trade in livestock and movement of mosquitoes are thought to be responsible for the outbreaks occurring outside endemic or enzootic regions. Virus spillover events contribute to outbreaks as was demonstrated by the largest epidemic of 1977 in Egypt. Genomic surveillance of the virus evolution is crucial in developing intervention strategies. Therefore, we have developed a computational tool for rapidly classifying and assigning lineages of the RVFV isolates. The computational method is presented both as a command line tool and a web application hosted at https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/rvfv/. Validation of the tool has been performed on a large dataset using glycoprotein gene (Gn) and whole genome sequences of the Large (L), Medium (M) and Small (S) segments of the RVFV retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database. Using the Gn nucleotide sequences, the RVFV typing tool was able to correctly classify all 234 RVFV sequences at species level with 100% specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. All the sequences in lineages A (n = 10), B (n = 1), C (n = 88), D (n = 1), E (n = 3), F (n = 2), G (n = 2), H (n = 105), I (n = 2), J (n = 1), K (n = 4), L (n = 8), M (n = 1), N (n = 5) and O (n = 1) were also correctly classified at phylogenetic level. Lineage assignment using whole RVFV genome sequences (L, M and S-segments) did not achieve 100% specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for all the sequences analyzed. We further tested our tool using genomic data that we generated by sequencing 5 samples collected following a recent RVF outbreak in Kenya. All the 5 samples were assigned lineage C by both the partial (Gn) and whole genome sequence classifiers. The tool is useful in tracing the origin of outbreaks and supporting surveillance efforts.

10.1016/j.ijid.2023.11.011,"• We observed rapid within-host evolution in the fatal case of Omicron FL.2. • Low-frequency SARS-CoV-2 mutations observed indicate within-host viral evolution. • Mutations in the Spike protein differed between two time points thirteen days apart. We investigated intra-host genetic evolution using two SARS-CoV-2 isolates from a fully vaccinated (primary schedule x2 doses of AstraZeneca plus a booster of Pfizer), >70-year-old woman with a history of lymphoma and hypertension who presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection for 3 weeks prior to death due to COVID-19. Two full genome sequences were determined from samples taken 13 days apart with both belonging to Pango lineage FL.2: the first detection of this Omicron sub-variant in Botswana. FL.2 is a sub-lineage of XBB.1.9.1. The repertoire of mutations and minority variants in the Spike protein differed between the two time points. Notably, we also observed deletions within the ORF1a and Membrane proteins; both regions are associated with high T-cell epitope density. The internal milieu of immune-suppressed individuals may accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution; hence, close monitoring is warranted.

10.1002/bies.202300152,"Mechanisms occurring at the atomic level are now known to drive processes essential for life, as revealed by quantum effects on biochemical reactions. Some macroscopic characteristics of organisms may thus show an atomic imprint, which may be transferred across organisms and affect their evolution. This possibility is considered here for the first time, with the aim of elucidating the appearance of an animal innovation with an unclear evolutionary origin: migratory behaviour. This trait may be mediated by a radical pair (RP) mechanism in the retinal flavoprotein cryptochrome, providing essential magnetic orientation for migration. Isotopes may affect the performance of quantum processes through their nuclear spin. Here, we consider a simple model and then apply the standard open quantum system approach to the spin dynamics of cryptochrome RP. We changed the spin quantum number (I) and g‐factor of hydrogen and nitrogen isotopes to investigate their effect on RP's yield and magnetic sensitivity. Strong differences arose between isotopes with I = 1 and I = 1/2 in their contribution to cryptochrome magnetic sensitivity, particularly regarding Earth's magnetic field strengths (25–65 µT). In most cases, isotopic substitution improved RP's magnetic sensitivity. Migratory behaviour may thus have been favoured in animals with certain isotopic compositions of cryptochrome.

10.1186/s12978-022-01419-5,"Background: South Africa has made significant progress in scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve the aspirational goal of HIV epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HIV, assess progress towards each of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) indicators and determine factors associated with achieving viral suppression among pregnant adolescents and women living with HIV in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: Pregnant adolescents and women, 12 years and older seeking antenatal care at six primary health care clinics were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Following written informed consent, structured questionnaires were administered, and finger-prick blood samples were collected for HIV antibody testing and viral load measurement. Viral suppression was defined as HIV viral load of < 400 copies per mL. Results: Between Dec 2016 and March 2017, among the 546 enrolled participants, data for 545 were analysed. The overall HIV prevalence was 40.2% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 36.1–44.3]. Age-stratified prevalence increased from 22.1% (95% CI, 15.9–30.0) in the 14–19 year age group to 63.9% (95% CI, 55.1–71.9) among women ≥ 30 years (Χ2 trend P < 0.0001). Of the HIV positive participants, 84.5% (95% CI, 79.0–88.8) knew their HIV positive status, 98.3% (95% CI 95.1–99.4) who knew their status were on ART, and of those on ART, 95.9% (95% CI 91.8–98.0) were virally suppressed. Among all HIV-positives 90.8% (95% CI, 86.3–94.0) had achieved viral suppression, whilst those in the 14–19 year age group were least likely to be virally suppressed at 82.8% (95% CI 65.5–92.4) compared to those in the older age groups. Married women compared to those unmarried were more likely to have achieved viral suppression (PRR) of 1.11 (95% CI 1.05–1.18), P < 0.001. Conclusions: The proportion of HIV positive pregnant women achieving viral suppression was encouraging though far short of the target towards achieving epidemic control. Importantly, adolescent pregnant women were less likely to know their HIV status and to achieve viral suppression, underscoring the public health implications of sustained risk of HIV transmission. Thus, greater effort and strong social support are essential to improve HIV knowledge of status and care continuum towards the goal to achieving HIV epidemic control. Plain language summary: To ""fast-track"" the response to achieve HIV epidemic control and end the AIDS epidemic, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set ambitious HIV testing and treatment targets for people living with HIV. Meeting these targets through scaling up testing for HIV, initiating and sustaining antiretroviral therapy (ART) to maintain viral suppression provides both therapeutic and preventive benefits with the potential to reduce HIV transmission. Viral suppression among pregnant adolescents and women living with HIV is crucial for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV including onward transmission to sexual partners. As a public health approach, in South Africa all pregnant women are offered routine HIV testing and immediate initiation of lifelong ART irrespective of CD4 cell count. It is, therefore, important to ascertain progress towards reaching the targets. The proportion of HIV positive pregnant adolescents and women achieving viral suppression was encouraging though far short of the target towards achieving epidemic control. Importantly, pregnant adolescents were less likely to know their HIV status and to achieve viral suppression, underscoring the public health implications of sustained risk of HIV transmission. Thus, greater effort and strong social support are essential to improve HIV knowledge of status and care continuum towards the goal to achieving HIV epidemic control.

10.1007/s10798-020-09612-y,"Design feedback is an essential pedagogical tool that can help young novice designers navigate divergent and convergent paths while designing. However, design feedback is often met with resistance, which counteracts its potential to help novice designers evaluate their design and generate new solution directions. In this paper, we report on the construction and utilization of a design feedback intervention during a real-life design project with a group of primary school children (aged 8–12). The goal of the intervention was to stimulate young novice designers' creative thinking by guiding the design feedback dialogues with their peers and clients. The intervention was designed according to the following key principles: (1) guide towards a shared understanding of the design through low-level convergent feedback, (2) stimulate critical reflection and evaluation of the design to help identify and internalize possible shortcomings through high-level convergent feedback, and (3) provide a way to move forward by guiding new generative thoughts through high-level divergent feedback. Overall, the results show that the intervention can support young novice designers, their peers, and clients in engaging in constructive feedback dialogues, thereby stimulating their creative thinking. Our main contribution entails a detailed understanding of the successes and obstacles within the feedback dialogues, as guided by the intervention. Based on these results, we propose a set of refined design principles to inform feedback interventions. With this research we hope to give insight in the complexity of design feedback dialogues, while also inspiring design educators to actively try out these key principles.

10.1140/epjs/s11734-023-01067-1,"Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a crucial tool for characterizing and validating quantum devices and quantum algorithms. However, the problem of finite sampling leads to an estimated process matrix which is non-positive semi-definite (non-PSD), which can yield a reconstructed quantum channel that is non-physical. To address this problem, various methods have been proposed to correct the issue of finite sampling in the estimation of the process matrix. In this work, we perform a comparison of regularisation methods that will be used to tackle the problem of finite sampling in QPT. For this comparison we simulate some common single qubit quantum channels. We use two metrics, the minimum eigenvalue of the Choi matrix and the fidelity, to compare the effectiveness of these methods. Our results show that the spectral transformations perform the best overall in dealing with finite sampling present in reconstructing the quantum channel in the NISQ era.

Data fusion, especially integrating data sets, is important when working with complex systems. The success reported when trying to integrate different modalities is generally low and has been attributed to the lack of statistically considerate strategies focusing on the data handling process. Multiple stages of data handling must be carefully considered when dealing with multi-modal data. In this review, the different stages in the data analysis process were examined. The study revealed misconceptions surrounding the process and elucidated rules for purpose-driven approaches by examining the complexities of each stage and the impact the decisions made at each stage have on the resulting models. The two major modeling approaches are either supervised (discrimination, classification, prediction) or unsupervised (exploration). Supervised approaches were emphatic on the pre-processing steps and prioritized increasing performance. Unsupervised approaches were mostly used for preliminary steps. The review found aspects often neglected when it came to the data collection and capturing which in the end contributed to the low success in combining sensory and chemistry data.

This study investigated the association between access to clean water and sanitation on depression in rural South Africa utilizing the most recent data (year 2017) from the South African National Income Dynamics Study. Our study outcome was depression, based on the 10-item abridged version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (data available in SA-NIDS), the main exposures being access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities (i.e. flushing toilets). Two types of analyses were conducted: first, adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to assess the relationship between lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation to depression. Second, we conducted mediation analysis to investigate whether access to clean water mediated the relationship between lack of access to toilets and depression. A high proportion of rural participants lacked access to clean water (n = 6,188, 47.6%) and adequate toilets (n = 9,797, 81.6%). The regression analyses indicated that lack of access to both clean water (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06–1.39) and adequate sanitation (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10–1.69) were significantly associated with greater odds of depression. The mediation analysis indicated that access to clean water partially mediated the relationship between lack of access to adequate sanitation and depression, the total mediated effect being 18.2% (95% CI: 11.0%–51.0%). Most rural communities in South Africa lack access to basic services that are essential for human dignity and a decent quality of life, leading to opportunities for poor mental health, with its various consequences for socio-economic development and personal wellbeing, including avoidable depression.

10.1038/s41598-021-94289-z,"Model comparisons have been widely used to guide intervention strategies to control infectious diseases. Agreement between different models is crucial for providing robust evidence for policy-makers because differences in model properties can influence their predictions. In this study, we compared models implemented by two individual-based model simulators for HIV epidemiology in a heterosexual population with Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). For each model simulator, we constructed four models, starting from a simplified basic model and stepwise including more model complexity. For the resulting eight models, the predictions of the impact of behavioural interventions on the HIV epidemic in Yaoundé-Cameroon were compared. The results show that differences in model assumptions and model complexity can influence the size of the predicted impact of the intervention, as well as the predicted qualitative behaviour of the HIV epidemic after the intervention. These differences in predictions of an intervention were also observed for two models that agreed in their predictions of the HIV epidemic in the absence of that intervention. Without additional data, it is impossible to determine which of these two models is the most reliable. These findings highlight the importance of making more data available for the calibration and validation of epidemiological models.

10.1016/j.annepidem.2023.05.001,"Self-report of sensitive or stigmatized health states is often subject to social desirability and interviewer biases. To reduce such biases, we estimated the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using a list experiment. This population-representative study was nested within the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Ukonga ward of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Men and women aged ≥40 years were randomly assigned to receive a list of either four control items (i.e., the control group) or four control items plus an additional item on having had a disease through sexual contacts in the past 12 months (i.e., the treatment group). We calculated the mean difference in the total number of items to which respondents answered ""yes"" in the treatment versus control group and compared this prevalence estimate to the one measured by the direct question. A total of 2310 adults aged ≥40 years were enrolled in the study: 32% were male and 48% were aged 40–49 years. The estimated prevalence of having STIs in the past 12 months was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3–23.3) in the list experiment, almost 10 times higher than the estimated prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 1.3–2.4) based on the direct question (P <.001). STI prevalence remained high after adjusting for age, the number of lifetime sex partners, alcohol consumption and smoking in multivariate linear regression (15.6%; 95% CI 7.3–23.9). We found a substantially higher prevalence of STIs among older adults in urban Tanzania when we based our estimation on a list experiment rather than a direct question in a population-representative survey. List experiments should be considered to elimnate social desirability and interviewer biases in surveys of sensitive or stigmatized health states. The very high prevalence of STIs highlights the need for improved access to STI screening, prevention and treatment for older adults in urban Africa.

Where children are the subject of such discussions, the focus is often primarily on privacy concerns and consent relating to the use of their data. This paper highlights the unique challenges children face when it comes to online interferences with their decision-making, primarily due to their vulnerability, impressionability, the increased likelihood of disclosing personal information online, and their developmental capacities. These traits allow for practices such as hypernudging to be executed on them more accurately and with more serious consequences, specifically by potentially undermining their autonomy. We argue that children are autonomous agents in the making and thus require additional special protections to ensure that the development of their autonomy is safeguarded. This means that measures should be taken to prohibit most forms of hypernudging children and thus ensure that they are protected from this powerful technique of digital manipulation.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007893,"Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy–either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. Author summary: Calibration—that is, ""fitting"" the model to data—is a crucial part of using mathematical models to better forecast and control the population-level spread of infectious diseases. Evidence that the mathematical model is well-calibrated improves confidence that the model provides a realistic picture of the consequences of health policy decisions. To make informed decisions, Policymakers need information about uncertainty: i.e., what is the range of likely outcomes (rather than just a single prediction). Thus, modellers should also strive to provide accurate measurements of uncertainty, both for their model parameters and for their predictions. This systematic review provides an overview of the methods used to calibrate individual-based models (IBMs) of the spread of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. We found that less than half of the reviewed articles used reproducible, non-subjective calibration methods. For the remaining articles, the method could either not be identified or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method. Only one-third of the articles obtained estimates of parameter uncertainty. We conclude that the adoption of better-documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology.

10.1038/s41598-019-55689-4,"SimpactCyan is an open-source simulator for individual-based models in HIV epidemiology. Its core algorithm is written in C++ for computational efficiency, while the R and Python interfaces aim to make the tool accessible to the fast-growing community of R and Python users. Transmission, treatment and prevention of HIV infections in dynamic sexual networks are simulated by discrete events. A generic ""intervention"" event allows model parameters to be changed over time, and can be used to model medical and behavioural HIV prevention programmes. First, we describe a more efficient variant of the modified Next Reaction Method that drives our continuous-time simulator. Next, we outline key built-in features and assumptions of individual-based models formulated in SimpactCyan, and provide code snippets for how to formulate, execute and analyse models in SimpactCyan through its R and Python interfaces. Lastly, we give two examples of applications in HIV epidemiology: the first demonstrates how the software can be used to estimate the impact of progressive changes to the eligibility criteria for HIV treatment on HIV incidence. The second example illustrates the use of SimpactCyan as a data-generating tool for assessing the performance of a phylodynamic inference framework.

10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00723-X,"Recurrent disease outbreaks caused by a range of emerging and resurging pathogens over the past decade reveal major gaps in public health preparedness, detection, and response systems in Africa. Underlying causes of recurrent disease outbreaks include inadequacies in the detection of new infectious disease outbreaks in the community, in rapid pathogen identification, and in proactive surveillance systems. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of zoonotic outbreaks occur, there remains the perennial risk of outbreaks of new or re-emerging pathogens for which no vaccines or treatments are available. As the Ebola virus disease, COVID-19, and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks highlight, a major paradigm shift is required to establish an effective infrastructure and common frameworks for preparedness and to prompt national and regional public health responses to mitigate the effects of future pandemics in Africa.

10.1007/s00217-022-04198-2,"In the process of data modelling, interpretation of the results in a straightforward manner is often challenging. The model's statistical performance is linked to specific parameters, while the interpretation of the results in the context of the problem often relies on visualisation aids. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical pipeline to interpret a multiblock data fusion model using visualisation aids that combine dendrogram and scatterplot projections of model decomposition and variable/observation contributions. Two case studies were used, based on craft products (beer and gin). Sensory attributes, as well as targeted and untargeted chemical data were fused using multiple factor analysis (MFA) and the results subjected to agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The results are presented from the perspective of the model building process during which certain stop/go stages and criteria are discussed. The results are also presented from the perspective of the two case studies to illustrate how the chosen visualisations add value to the interpretation in context. The results showed that the products were not clustered according to any of the categories used to identify them (e.g. style, region, country, etc.) in each of the three data blocks as well as in the fused model. Thus, any supervised analysis to classify products according to these categories could not be pursued.

10.1186/s12879-023-08902-9,"Background: Periods of droughts can lead to decreased food security, and altered behaviours, potentially affecting outcomes on antiretroviral therapy (ART) among persons with HIV (PWH). We investigated whether decreased rainfall is associated with adverse outcomes among PWH on ART in Southern Africa. Methods: Data were combined from 11 clinical cohorts of PWH in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA) collaboration. Adult PWH who had started ART prior to 01/06/2016 and were in follow-up in the year prior to 01/06/2016 were included. Two-year rainfall from June 2014 to May 2016 at the location of each HIV centre was summed and ranked against historical 2-year rainfall amounts (1981–2016) to give an empirical relative percentile rainfall estimate. The IeDEA-SA and rainfall data were combined using each HIV centre's latitude/longitude. In individual-level analyses, multivariable Cox or generalized estimating equation regression models (GEEs) assessed associations between decreased rainfall versus historical levels and four separate outcomes (mortality, CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, viral loads > 400 copies/mL, and > 12-month gaps in follow-up) in the two years following the rainfall period. GEEs were used to investigate the association between relative rainfall and monthly numbers of unique visitors per HIV centre. Results: Among 270,708 PWH across 386 HIV centres (67% female, median age 39 [IQR: 32–46]), lower rainfall than usual was associated with higher mortality (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.18 [95%CI: 1.07–1.32] per 10 percentile rainfall rank decrease) and unsuppressed viral loads (adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.05 [1.01–1.09]). Levels of rainfall were not strongly associated with CD4 counts < 200 cell/mm3 or > 12-month gaps in care. HIV centres in areas with less rainfall than usual had lower numbers of PWH visiting them (adjusted Rate Ratio: 0.80 [0.66–0.98] per 10 percentile rainfall rank decrease). Conclusions: Decreased rainfall could negatively impact on HIV treatment behaviours and outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for these effects. Interventions to mitigate the health impact of severe weather events are required.

10.3390/genes14030705,"Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa and the sixth most affected by COVID-19 on the continent. Despite having experienced five infection waves, >499,000 cases, and ~7500 COVID-19-related deaths as of January 2023, there is still no detailed genomic epidemiological report on the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia. In this study, we reconstructed and elucidated the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we investigated the introduction, local transmission, ongoing evolution, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first four infection waves using 353 high-quality near-whole genomes sampled in Ethiopia. Our results show that whereas viral introductions seeded the first wave, subsequent waves were seeded by local transmission. The B.1.480 lineage emerged in the first wave and notably remained in circulation even after the emergence of the Alpha variant. The B.1.480 was outcompeted by the Delta variant. Notably, Ethiopia's lack of local sequencing capacity was further limited by sporadic, uneven, and insufficient sampling that limited the incorporation of genomic epidemiology in the epidemic public health response in Ethiopia. These results highlight Ethiopia's role in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and the urgent need for balanced, near-real-time genomic sequencing.

10.3390/nano13030572,"In recent years, the release of metal and metallic oxide engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into the environment has generated an increase in their accumulation in agricultural soils, which is a serious risk to the ecosystem and soil health. Here, we show the impact of ENPs on the physical and chemical properties of soils. A literature search was performed in the Scopus database using the keywords ENPs, plus soil physical properties or soil chemical properties, and elements availability. In general, we found that the presence of metal and metallic oxide ENPs in soils can increase hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity and reduce the distance between soil particles, as well as causing a variation in pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), redox potential (Eh), and soil organic matter (SOM) content. Furthermore, ENPs or the metal cations released from them in soils can interact with nutrients like phosphorus (P) forming complexes or precipitates, decreasing their bioavailability in the soil solution. The results depend on the soil properties and the doses, exposure duration, concentrations, and type of ENPs. Therefore, we suggest that particular attention should be paid to every kind of metal and metallic oxide ENPs deposited into the soil.

10.3390/nano13030399,"In the last decade, the application of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has garnered great attention as an adsorbent due to its low cost, non-toxicity, high porosity, and BET-specific surface area. In particular, the immobilization of nZVI particles onto inorganic and organic substrates (nanocomposites) decreased its agglomeration, allowing them to be effective and achieve greater adsorption of pollutants than pristine nanoparticles (NPs). Although nZVI began to be used around 2004 to remove pollutants, there are no comprehensive review studies about phosphate removal from aquatic systems to date. For this reason, this study will show different types of nZVI, pristine nZVI, and its nanocomposites, that exist on the market, how factors such as pH solution, oxygen, temperature, doses of adsorbent, initial phosphate concentration, and interferents affect phosphate adsorption capacity, and mechanisms involved in phosphate removal. We determined that nanocomposites did not always have higher phosphate adsorption than pristine nZVI particles. Moreover, phosphate can be removed by nZVI-based nanoadsorbents through electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, chemisorption, reduction, complexation, hydrogen bonding, and precipitation mechanisms. Using the partition coefficient (PC) values, we found that sepiolite-nZVI is the most effective nanoadsorbent that exists to remove phosphate from aqueous systems. We suggest future studies need to quantify the PC values for nZVI-based nanoadsorbents as well as ought to investigate their phosphate removal efficiency under natural environmental conditions.

10.1093/jtm/taac134,"<bold>Background: </bold>Human mobility changed in unprecedented ways during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March and April 2020, when lockdowns and large travel restrictions began in most countries, global air-travel almost entirely halted (92% decrease in commercial global air travel in the months between February and April 2020). Initial recovery in global air travel started around July 2020 and subsequently nearly tripled between May and July 2021. Here, we aim to establish a preliminary link between global mobility patterns and the synchrony of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves across the world.<bold>Methods: </bold>We compare epidemic peaks and human global mobility in two time periods: November 2020 to February 2021 (when just over 70 million passengers travelled), and November 2021 to February 2022 (when more than 200 million passengers travelled). We calculate the time interval during which continental epidemic peaks occurred for both of these time periods, and we calculate the pairwise correlations of epidemic waves between all pairs of countries for the same time periods.<bold>Results: </bold>We find that as air travel increases at the end of 2021, epidemic peaks around the world are more synchronous with one another, both globally and regionally. Continental epidemic peaks occur globally within a 20 day interval at the end of 2021 compared to 73 days at the end of 2020, and epidemic waves globally are more correlated with one another at the end of 2021.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This suggests that the rebound in human mobility dictates the synchrony of global and regional epidemic waves. In line with theoretical work, we show that in a more connected world, epidemic dynamics are more synchronized.

This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom. A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed. Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery. Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock. The addition of antihistamine and corticosteroids to adrenaline for premedication has no added benefit. [Display omitted] • Snakebites are common in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.

10.1016/j.knosys.2024.111880,"In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called 'The Hiking Optimization Algorithm' (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA's mathematical model is premised on Tobler's Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers' positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA's performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman's and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA's results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn's post hoc test for the performance evaluation. HOA's results are competitive and, in many instances, outperform the aforementioned well-known metaheuristics.

10.1093/cid/ciab1008,"Background People living with HIV (PLWH) have been reported to have a higher risk of more severe COVID-19 disease and death. We assessed the ability of the Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine to elicit neutralizing activity against the Delta variant in PLWH relative to HIV-negative individuals. We also examined effects of HIV status and suppression on Delta neutralization response in SARS-CoV-2—infected unvaccinated participants. Methods We enrolled participants who were vaccinated through the SISONKE South African clinical trial of the Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine in healthcare workers (HCWs). PLWH in this group had well-controlled HIV infection. We also enrolled unvaccinated participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Neutralization capacity was assessed by a live virus neutralization assay of the Delta variant. Results Most Ad26.CoV2.S vaccinated HCWs were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this group, Delta variant neutralization was 9-fold higher compared with the infected-only group and 26-fold higher relative to the vaccinated-only group. No decrease in Delta variant neutralization was observed in PLWH relative to HIV-negative participants. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2—infected, unvaccinated PLWH showed 7-fold lower neutralization and a higher frequency of nonresponders, with the highest frequency of nonresponders in people with HIV viremia. Vaccinated-only participants showed low neutralization capacity. Conclusions The neutralization response of the Delta variant following Ad26.CoV2.S vaccination in PLWH with well-controlled HIV was not inferior to HIV-negative participants, irrespective of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. In SARS-CoV-2—infected and nonvaccinated participants, HIV infection reduced the neutralization response to SARS-CoV-2, with the strongest reduction in HIV viremic individuals.

10.1016/j.jim.2024.113656,"Cytokines are important mediators of immunity in the female genital tract, and their levels may be associated with various reproductive health outcomes. However, the measurement of cytokines and chemokines in vaginal fluid samples may be influenced by a variety of factors, each with the potential to affect the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay, including the interpretation and comparison of data. We measured and compared cytokine milieu in samples collected via Softcup® menstrual cup versus vulvovaginal swabs. One hundred and eighty vulvovaginal swabs from CAPRISA 088 and 42 Softcup supernatants from CAPRISA 016 cohorts of pregnant women were used to measure the concentrations of 28 cytokines through multiplexing. Cytokines measured in this study were detectable in each of the methods however, SoftCup supernatants showed consistently, higher detectability, expression ratios, and mean concentration of cytokines than vulvovaginal swabs. While mean concentrations differed, the majority of cytokines correlated between SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swabs. Additionally, there were no significant differences in a number of participants between the two sampling methods for the classification of genital inflammation. Our findings suggest that SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swab samples are suitable for the collection of genital specimens to study biological markers of genital inflammatory response. However, the Softcup menstrual cup performs better for the detection and quantification of soluble biomarkers that are found in low concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid.

10.7554/eLife.67397,"There are conflicting reports on the effects of HIV on COVID-19. Here, we analyzed disease severity and immune cell changes during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in 236 participants from South Africa, of which 39% were people living with HIV (PLWH), during the first and second (Beta dominated) infection waves. The second wave had more PLWH requiring supplemental oxygen relative to HIV-negative participants. Higher disease severity was associated with low CD4 T cell counts and higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR). Yet, CD4 counts recovered and NLR stabilized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance in wave 2 infected PLWH, arguing for an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection leading to low CD4 and high NLR. The first infection wave, where severity in HIV negative and PLWH was similar, still showed some HIV modulation of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Therefore, HIV infection can synergize with the SARS-CoV-2 variant to change COVID-19 outcomes.

10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.06.013,"• This paper presents the CoDeT (Collaborative design thinking) approach, developed for co-design settings characterized by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children) such as schools, libraries and maker spaces. • Children often lack a basic understanding of the design process and skills to collaborate productively with peers; CoDeT addresses these challenges by scaffolding collaboration and design thinking. • To scaffold collaboration and design thinking, CoDeT relies on a framework that integrates social interdependence theory and design Thinking; this framework was validated in a case study with 49 children between 9 and 10 years old in two schools. This paper presents the Collaborative Design Thinking (CoDeT) co-design approach, its theoretical framework, and its application in a case study with 49 children aged 9 to 10 in two schools. CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach. CoDeT was first applied in a case study and yielded promising results in terms of children's collaboration and design thinking skills, yet possible improvements were found. The insights of this case study informed the revised version of CoDeT presented at the end of this article, in a what-why-how structure, allowing researchers and practitioners to apply the co-design approach in a wide variety of contexts characterised by high child-to-adult ratios.

10.3390/info12100405,"This research attempts to introduce the production methodology of an anomaly detection dataset using ten desirable requirements. Subsequently, the article presents the produced dataset named UGRansome, created with up-to-date and modern network traffic (netflow), which represents cyclostationary patterns of normal and abnormal classes of threatening behaviours. It was discovered that the timestamp of various network attacks is inferior to one minute and this feature pattern was used to record the time taken by the threat to infiltrate a network node. The main asset of the proposed dataset is its implication in the detection of zero-day attacks and anomalies that have not been explored before and cannot be recognised by known threats signatures. For instance, the UDP Scan attack has been found to utilise the lowest netflow in the corpus, while the Razy utilises the highest one. In turn, the EDA2 and Globe malware are the most abnormal zero-day threats in the proposed dataset. These feature patterns are included in the corpus, but derived from two well-known datasets, namely, UGR'16 and ransomware that include real-life instances. The former incorporates cyclostationary patterns while the latter includes ransomware features. The UGRansome dataset was tested with cross-validation and compared to the KDD99 and NSL-KDD datasets to assess the performance of Ensemble Learning algorithms. False alarms have been minimized with a null empirical error during the experiment, which demonstrates that implementing the Random Forest algorithm applied to UGRansome can facilitate accurate results to enhance zero-day threats detection. Additionally, most zero-day threats such as Razy, Globe, EDA2, and TowerWeb are recognised as advanced persistent threats that are cyclostationary in nature and it is predicted that they will be using spamming and phishing for intrusion. Lastly, achieving the UGRansome balance was found to be NP-Hard due to real life-threatening classes that do not have a uniform distribution in terms of several instances.

10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139836,"Zero–valent copper engineered nanoparticles (Cu–ENPs) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (IP) to plants. In this study, we used adsorption–desorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) on IP availability in Santa Barbara (SB) volcanic ash soil. X–Ray Diffraction results showed that Cu–ENPs were formed by a mixture of Cu metallic and Cu oxides (Cu 2 O or/and CuO) species, while specific surface area values showed that Cu–ENPs/25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm. The kinetic IP adsorption of SB soil without and with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudo–second–order (k 2 = 0.45–1.13 x 10−3 kg mmol−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.999, and RSS ≤ 0.091) and Elovich (α = 14621.10–3136.20 mmol kg−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.984, and RSS ≤ 69) models. Thus, the rate–limiting step for IP adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms without Cu–ENPs were fitted well to the Freundlich model, while with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm), isotherms were described best by the Freundlich and/or Langmuir model. The IP relative adsorption capacity (K F) was higher with 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm (K F = 110.41) than for 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm (K F = 74.40) and for SB soil (K F = 48.17). This study showed that plausible IP retention mechanisms in the presence of 1% Cu–ENPs in SB soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) co–precipitate formation. The desorption study demonstrated that 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm increased the affinity of IP in SB soil with a greater effect than 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm. Thus, both the studied size ranges of Cu–ENPs could favor an accumulation of IP in volcanic ash soils. [Display omitted] • IP adsorption on SB soil was higher with Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm than with Cu–ENPs/25 nm. • IP adsorption on SB soil with Cu–ENPs (25 nm or 40–60 nm) reached equilibrium in 720 min. • IP desorption from SB soil was lower with Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm than with Cu–ENPs/25 nm. • Retention mechanisms with Cu–ENPs (25 nm or 40–60 nm) in SB soil were ligand exchange, electrostatic attraction, and co–precipitate formation.

Concerns around accuracy and performance of rapid antigen tests continue to be raised with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. To evaluate the performance of two widely used SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests during BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa (May – June 2022). A prospective field evaluation compared the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test from Hangzhou AllTest Biotech (nasal swab) and the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test from SD Biosensor (nasopharyngeal swab) to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (nasopharyngeal swab) on samples collected from 540 study participants. Overall 28.52% (154/540) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive with median cycle number value of 12.30 (IQR 9.30–19.40). Out of the 99 successfully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 18 were classified as BA.4 and 56 were classified as BA.5. The overall sensitivities of the AllTest SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test were 73.38% (95% CI 65.89–79.73) and 74.03% (95% CI 66.58–80.31) and their specificities were 97.41% (95% CI 95.30–98.59) and 99.22% (95% CI 97.74–99.74) respectively. Sensitivity was >90% when the cycle number value was <20. The sensitivity of both rapid tests was >90% in samples infected with Omicron sub-lineage BA.4 and BA.5. Accuracy of tested rapid antigen tests that target the nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 protein, were not adversely affected by BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants.

10.1016/j.cell.2023.06.001,"The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility. Our study highlights the rapid dispersal of highly transmissible variants, with implications for genomic surveillance along the hierarchical airline network. [Display omitted] • Global phylogenetic analysis reveals dispersal of VOCs along worldwide flight network • Omicron spread to five times more countries within 100 days of emergence than other VOCs • Delta and Omicron dispersed from secondary hubs during times of accelerating air travel • Highly connected countries were major global and regional exporters of VOCs Data analysis clarifies that dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 variants from their sites of initial detection was related to the amount of global air travel at the time of the variant's emergence and that travel volume through ""hub"" sites distinct from the site of emergence was a key driver of variant spread.

Sample preparation conditions and method performance were evaluated. Precision ranged from 1% to 10% for beer and 2–12% for gin, accuracy from 84 % to 118% for beer and 10–124% for gin. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for beer ranged from 0.04 to 6 µg/L and 0.1–19 µg/L respectively. LOD and LOQ for gin ranged from 0.02 to 2.3 µg/L and 0.05–7.5 µg/L respectively. In addition, the stability of selected terpenoids (as class representatives) was assessed in a synthetic beer using a targeted and non-targeted approach at various temperatures (4, 25 and 50C) over 40 days. The optimized method was successfully applied to commercial craft beers (n = 34) and gins (n = 21). The main contributors to the beer profile were β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, and geraniol, and for gin 1,8-cineole, cis-rose oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, valencene, and citronellol.
