The app integrates basic computational concepts with graphic design principles, providing a unique platform for users to improve problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and logical reasoning skills. This study used a research and development (R&D) approach with the 4-D Model (define, design, develop, and disseminate) as a guide. The validity test with experts categorized CT-Mobile as ""valid"" with values of 0.85 and 0.88 from media experts and material experts. The practicality of this application was rated as ""very practical"" by teachers (89.67%) and students (86.34%). These findings confirm the significant benefits of CT-Mobile in graphic design learning, both for educators and students. The analysis showed a positive impact on users' CT ability, reflected by improved problem-solving efficiency and a deeper understanding of algorithmic processes. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between mobile application development, graphic design education, and the development of CT skills. CT-Mobile emerges as a promising tool to bridge technology, creativity, and cognitive skill development in the digital age.

The findings of the model provide an evaluation of cognitive aspects, affective aspects in the form of 4C soft skills, and psychomotor aspects. To measure the effectiveness of the model, we will test the differences in the quality of student learning outcomes between two groups: the control group and the experimental group. The cognitive test results showed a value of 80.85 for the experimental class and 73.21 for the control class. For the assessment of soft skill 4C, student creativity aspects are superior to other aspects. Whereas for aspects of enhancing the project's value, an important finding from the results obtained is the signifi- cant improvement in the quality of learning by incorporating computational thinking into the problem-based learning (PBL) model.

Measuring the level of CTS becomes essential to ensure that administrators effectively leverage technology. However, finding suitable instruments to measure and justify CTS levels in administration can be challenging. The selection of situational judgement test (SJT) is supported by its validity and reliability in assessing attributes, including professionalism. The instrument's development includes face validity, discriminant validity (using Pearson correlation and Cronbach's alpha), and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The study involved 111 undergraduate administration students from various Indonesian universities, and data were collected in 2023. Following a discriminant validity analysis, ten items were eliminated, while 23 met the criteria with p<0.050 and r>0.185. Subsequently, EFA yielded 16 items forming seven components, covering algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, technology literacy, problem abstraction, problem reformulation, data management in administration technology, and administrative data presentation with loading factor variations (0.421-0.868). The final instrument, consisting of 16 valid items and seven components, effectively evaluates the level of administrator computational thinking skills (ACTS) among administration students.

A total of 98 in-service and pre-service teachers who participated in a robotics teaching professional development workshop served as the sample of the study. A survey including the Computational Thinking Scale, the Design Thinking Disposition Scale, the Robotics Teaching Beliefs Scale and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge–Robotics Scale was conducted after the workshop. A confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the measurement constructs, and Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was utilized to examine the relationships among the factors. The results revealed that both CT and DT dispositions could positively predict teachers' robotics teaching beliefs, which subsequently predicted their RPCK. Moreover, a direct positive relationship between CT and RPCK was identified, while such a relationship was not evident for DT. The model demonstrates the critical role of CT in shaping teachers' beliefs and pedagogical strategies of robotics teaching, and provides insights into the indirect influence of DT. Finally, the Model of Robotics Teaching Professional Development (MRTPD) was proposed to profile how to promote teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of robotics teaching from their CT and DT dispositions.

Objectives: This study seeks to explore the effectiveness of integrating AIGC into programming learning through debugging. First, the study presents three levels of AIGC integration based on varying levels of abstraction. Then, drawing on extended effective use theory, the study proposes the underlying mechanism of how AIGC integration impacts programming learning performance and computational thinking. Methods: Three debugging interfaces integrated with AIGC by ChatGPT were developed for this study according to three levels of AIGC integration design. The study conducts a between‐subject experiment with one control group and three experimental groups. Analysis of covariance and a structural equation model are employed to examine the effects. Results and Conclusions: The results show that the second and third levels of abstraction in AIGC integration yield better learning performance and computational thinking, but the first level shows no difference compared to traditional debugging. The underlying mechanism suggests that the second and third levels of abstraction promote transparent interaction, which enhances representational fidelity and consequently impacts learning performance and computational thinking, as evidenced in test of the mechanism. Moreover, the study finds that learning fidelity weakens the effect of transparent interaction on representational fidelity. Our research offers valuable theoretical and practical insights. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter?: In the present information era, programming and computational thinking are important.AIGC has attracted remarkable attention from both academics and managers.If it is appropriately utilised, AIGC can facilitate education.

The intricate and nuanced relationships between CT and cognitive variations emphasize the needs to accommodate diverse cognitive profiles when fostering CT skills, recognizing that these cognitive functions can manifest as either strengths or limitations in different students. Consequently, understanding the connections between students' cognitive functions and CT skills assumes pivotal importance in the design of personalized instructional strategies for CT. Despite a general consideration of learning variability in CT education, empirical insights exploring the correlation between cognitive skills and CT competencies remain notably scarce. This study endeavors to bridge this research gap by investigating the links between executive functions and CT skills, as well as the associations between their sub-dimensions. The results reveal a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.452 between these two domains, underscoring the notable connection between executive functions and CT abilities. Furthermore, the sub-dimensional analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of how specific executive functions uniquely contribute to certain CT skills. In light of these findings, this research offers a promising pathway for the development of tailored CT education programs that can cater to the unique needs of each individual, ultimately facilitating inclusive CT programs and making significant contributions to broaden STEM education and future workforce.

Encompassing 51 independent effect sizes, the meta-analysis involves a participant pool of 9181 individuals from various countries, comprising 4254 males and 4927 females. Results indicate statistically significant gender differences in CT (Hedges's g = 0.091, p <.05), albeit with a modest effect size, revealing higher CT scores among males compared to females. Further moderation analyses unveil the multifaceted nature of these gender differences. Specifically, while gender differences become significant during high school, recent studies suggest a gradual reduction in CT gender differences with societal progress among K-12 students. Moreover, findings illustrate variations in gender differences across geographical regions. Notably, while the overall gender disparity in CT is non-significant in the ""East Asia and Pacific"" region, it widens in ""North America"" and ""Europe"", with males scoring higher than females. Conversely, in ""Europe and Central Asia"", such gender differences present inconsistent outcomes, with females scoring higher than males. Importantly, assessment tool type does not significantly influence gender differences. Lastly, this study offers recommendations to address CT gender gaps, providing valuable insights for promoting gender equality in education.

In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to address two main objectives: (a) the effectiveness of empirical interventions on the development of CT in children aged of 3–8 years; and (b) the variables that influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d =.83 [95% CI: 730,.890]; p <.001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed.

It is a key skill for children in the 21st century. However, it is unclear how CT can be developed most effectively in children. Several pedagogical methodologies have been proposed and are being investigated. The main aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis which states that using three‐dimensional (3D) simulated robots helps in the learning of programming and CT concepts, such as directions, loops, conditionals, and functions. The research questions are: Does this hypothesis hold true? Are some concepts easier or better learned than others and to what extent? The goal is to measure and evaluate the effect of using as a learning tool a platform with 3D simulated robots and realistic physics, and compare it with the standard Scratch learning tool which does not use robotics but a two‐dimensional (2D) cartoon avatar they are already familiar with. For practical reasons, a quasiexperimental design with nonequivalent groups and 85 second‐year Secondary Education students (ages 12–13) was performed. They were separated into control and experimental groups and followed a seven‐session intervention with the baseline 2D Scratch and the 3D simulated robots platform, respectively. Both used a visual block programming language and the same activities. To have quantitative and reliable results, a widely accepted CT test has been used, pre‐ and postintervention. Also qualitative feedback is presented. The obtained results show that using the platform with simulated 3D robots significantly helps when developing students' CT. With it, the students do learn basic programming concepts and reach higher scores in the CT test. This improvement applies to all CT‐analyzed concepts except in functions where the grades are maintained. Furthermore, students manage to master the activities on the 3D simulated robots platform, which reflects on the empowerment the platform has got in them.

Debugging is particularly underrepresented in the CT training literature. This multi-level meta-analysis focused on debugging as a core CT skill, and investigated the effects of various debugging interventions. Moderator analyses revealed which interventions were effective, in which situations, and for what kind of learner. A significant overall mean effect of debugging interventions ( g ¯ = 0.64, CI = (0.32, 0.96), p <.001), was found based on 62 effect sizes from 18 source articles. Significant between-studies variation indicated that true effects could range from −0.54 to 1.82. In addition, sensitivity analyses and checks on confounding provided further understandings of intervention features and their impacts. Interventions using enhanced debuggers and systematic instruction were particularly effective in fostering debugging skills. Debugging intervention effects varied by participant population and potentially by publication type. Moreover, debugging interventions had impact regardless of how debugging skills were measured, programming medium used, control-group type, and whether the study was randomized. Future studies should investigate the best practices for improving debugging abilities for whom and under what circumstances.

Software (SW) education and physical computing education are frequently addressed topics in technology education, but education about computational thinking (CT) lacks interest and research. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop educational programs in technology. In this study, we developed a program integrating CT, which centered on technological problem-solving processes. The program comprised 12 total hours of hacking a remote control (RC) car using Micro:bit development tool. This study investigates the effects of the developed program with a single group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design. Nineteen students participated in the study, completing survey instruments that measure CT competency and attitudes toward CT and technology, answering an open-ended questionnaire, and voluntarily took part in semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the technological problem-solving program positively affected participants' CT-related competencies. Moreover, we observed improvement in participants' attitudes toward technology due to the integration of CT into their technology education classes. This study provides a strong case for incorporating CT into technology education. It also suggests future research direction regarding the development of students' CT competencies in various technological problem-solving contexts.

"Correlation analysis between sub-element of technological thinking disposition and computational thinking of gifted students in South Korea.","Choi, Yong-Woon; Go, In-gyu; Gil, Yeong-Jae","International Journal of Technology & Design Education",="09577572",,="Nov2024","34","5","1835","23","179690132","10.1007/s10798-024-09888-4","Springer Nature","Article","SOUTH Korea; GIFTED & talented education; ADVANCED students; SCHOOL children; ARTIFICIAL intelligence; TEACHING methods; BRITISH education system","Computational thinking; Technological thinking disposition; Technology education","The purpose of this study is to derive a correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the computational thinking ability of gifted students in Korea. The correlation between each element was analyzed by looking at the sub-elements of computational thinking according to the components of technological thinking disposition. The experiment was conducted from September 2019 to February 2021 with 217 students of I Gifted School in Incheon, South Korea. The collected data were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient using the statistical program R using Google COLAB. A summary of the study results is as follows. First, regarding the correlation between technological thinking ability, among the 6 components of technological thinking disposition, technological creativity and expression disposition and technological manipulation disposition show the highest correlation at 0.851. This shows that students who have an excellent ability to implement algorithms with new ideas or express them in various other attempts when implementing programs for gifted students also tend to enjoy program coding or have a tendency to like coding. Second, concerning the correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the sub-factors of computational thinking, some elements showed negative correlations and some had almost no correlation index. Students with high technological curiosity, however, tended to show a 0.287 in the parallelism factor compared to other factors. This showed a generally high trend. It can be said that students who want to know the functions, uses, forms, and characteristics of functions while implementing programs tend to have a better ability to divide large tasks into smaller tasks and process them simultaneously compared with other sub-elements of computational thinking. Third, regarding the correlation between computational thinking skills, the correlation between data analysis and pattern recognition was the highest at 0.637. This indicates that students who have an excellent ability to analyze a given coding problem also can find rules in data, showing that students at gifted schools in Korea tend to enjoy problem-solving.

The shift to online or hybrid learning models posed a significant challenge for educators, particularly those lacking digital skills. The study sought to answer several research questions, including the impact of online versus in‐person teaching on preuniversity students and gender differences in Computer Science perception, and Computational Thinking skills performance. The study employed a four‐phase methodology, consisting of pre‐ and posttraining measurements of Computer Science perception and Computational Thinking skills development through specific activities delivered in‐person or online. The results indicate that in‐person training is more effective for developing Computational Thinking skills, particularly at the secondary education level. Furthermore, there is a need to focus on maintaining girls' interest in Computer Science during primary school, as interest levels tend to decline significantly in secondary school. These findings have significant implications for Engineering Education in the context of digital transformation and the increasing importance of Computational Thinking skills in various fields of engineering. This study highlights the importance of developing Computational Thinking skills among preuniversity students and the need for effective training methods to achieve this goal and underscore the significance of investing in Engineering Education to prepare the next generation of engineers for the rapidly changing digital landscape.

Although countless efforts have been invested across K‐12 education, there is a paucity of research at the postsecondary level about the extent to which CT can contribute to sustainable learning outcomes. Objectives: The current study examines how a series of Arduino‐based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT. Methods: College students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think‐alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments. Results and Conclusions: Students verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging. Students exposed to active learning performed better in a virtual robotics challenge compared to their peers in a traditional‐oriented classroom. Students' scores on the physical robotics challenge increased as a function of the number of references they made to CT concepts during the think‐alouds. It is possible to design pedagogical experiences that tap into various dimensions of CT at incremental levels of complexity through a series of Arduino‐based robotics activities. With the integration of an online simulation, students can visualize and transfer their CT skills between a virtual and physical learning environment, thus leading to more sustainable learning outcomes. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) is the conceptual foundation for problem‐solving.CT shifted from unplugged to plugged activities.CT concepts can be fostered through educational robotics. What this paper adds: A multi‐dimensional approach to assessing CT.Applications of CT provide insights into skill transfer.An integrative theoretical approach to study the 'how' and the 'what' of CT. Implications for practice: Educational robotics activities can cater to a fuller range of CT skills.Virtual simulations with constructive feedback are beneficial for students in traditional settings.Mixed learning environments contribute to making links between lectures and labs.

Cumulative research was conducted to investigate the influencing factors of CT learning performance, and an ample range of factors has been identified, involving both cognitive and non‐cognitive facets. However, limited has been done in exploring the non‐cognitive factors, and even less at the primary education level. Objective: To address this gap, this study bridged CT with personality in the primary school context, and more importantly, it proposed a mediator in the personality‐CT relationship that is, attitudinal beliefs, which are amenable to change, thereby allowing further support for nurturing the traits. Method: Based on the Big Five model of personality, standard tests were administered to a sample of 434 primary school students (ages 8–11), and data were analysed using structural equation modelling via Mplus. To improve the robustness of the results, control variables (i.e., demographic features, coding experience) were added to the research model, and a bootstrap approach with 5000 resamples was used to examine the mediating effect. Result and Conclusion: Findings demonstrated that Conscientiousness had a positive effect on CT, and attitudinal beliefs mediated the effect of Open‐mindedness (positive) and Negative Emotionality (negative) on CT. The study contributes to the literature by enriching the CT network with non‐intellectual components and unravelling the mechanism of CT regarding how disposition traits turn into learning performance. The results implicate practitioners on the importance of encouraging conscientious behaviours and nurturing positive attitudinal beliefs in CT primary education. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Personality traits can play a role in students' learning performance.The relationship between personality and computational thinking (CT) has been verified in teenage cohorts.Simply studying personalities may have limited practical implications, as these traits tend to be stable features that practitioners have little control over. What this paper adds: This is the first study investigating the effect of personalities on CT performance at the primary education level.The study examined the association between conscientiousness and CT performance.This is the first study revealing the underlying mechanism of the personality‐CT relationship.The study identified the mediating role of attitudinal beliefs in the personality‐CT relationship. The implications of study findings for practitioners: The study enriched the nomological network of CT in the primary context with essential non‐cognitive components.The study unravelled the underlying mechanism of the personality‐CT relationship, helping explain how personality traits turn into learning performance.The study indicated the importance of encouraging conscientious behaviours and nurturing positive attitudinal beliefs in CT primary education.

"Primary school students' perceptions and developed artefacts and language from learning coding and computational thinking using the 3C model.","Martin, David A.; Curtis, Peter; Redmond, Petrea","Journal of Computer Assisted Learning",="02664909",,="Aug2024","40","4","1616","16","178531905","10.1111/jcal.12972","Wiley-Blackwell","Article","LANGUAGE & languages; CURRICULUM; COMPUTERS; QUALITATIVE research; INTERVIEWING; EDUCATIONAL outcomes; PROBLEM solving; REFLECTION (Philosophy); JUDGMENT sampling; THEMATIC analysis; SCHOOL children; MEDICAL coding; RESEARCH methodology; ABILITY; STUDENT attitudes; LEARNING strategies; DATA analysis software; TRAINING","3C model; coding; computational thinking; digital technologies; mathematics instruction; primary school","Background: A resurgence in teaching coding in primary school classrooms has led to a pedagogical swing towards using physical computing and coding to develop students' use of algorithms, computational thinking, and problem‐solving skills. Two obstacles impede the optimal development of these objectives: the availability of a suitable pedagogy and an instructional sequencing model for primary school teachers to effectively present coding and computational thinking concepts and skills to students in alignment with their developmental stage. Objective: This study aims to address both obstacles by introducing the 3C Model, a newly developed instructional sequence grounded in established pedagogies and designed to effectively teach coding and computational thinking skills to primary school students based on their developmental stage. Methods: The qualitative study employed two data sources to triangulate findings, using: (1) semi‐structured interviews and thematic analysis to investigate 11 primary school students' perceptions of their learning experiences with the 3C Model, and (2) researcher observations along with reflections of the students' developed and demonstrated learning through the method of knowing‐in‐action, reflection‐in‐action, and reflection‐on‐action. Results and Conclusions: The findings of this study fill a gap in the existing literature by demonstrating that the pedagogical and sequential approach embedded in the 3C Model not only enhanced students' engagement levels but also resulted in improved curriculum learning outcomes. The 3C Model provides teachers with a coherent and age‐appropriate instructional structure. It uses physical computing devices and digital coding platforms to introduce coding concepts, furthering the development of computational thinking skills in primary school students beyond mere procedural and rote learning. Implications: The study holds important implications for practical applications, as it addresses an absence in the literature of an established pedagogy and instructional sequencing model for effectively teaching coding and computational thinking concepts and skills to primary school students. Drawing on established pedagogical and developmental learning theories, the 3C Model provides primary school teachers with an engaging, age‐appropriate instructional method that avoids decontextualised teaching and surface‐based learning. Instead, it encourages collaborative student work and contextualised learning, steering away from isolated and generic approaches. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic: Teaching coding and computational thinking concepts and skills is complex due to their abstract nature.Teaching resources such as work samples, curriculum connections and tools are available to primary school teachers.There is no consensus on the most effective methods to teach these abstract concepts and skills.Primary school teachers default to applying general teaching strategies due to the lack of an age‐appropriate, specific activity sequencing model to use during coding instruction. What does this paper add: The study fills the existing gap by presenting a newly conceptualised instructional model, which considers the students' developmental stage of learning and pedagogical best practices.The study trialled the 3C Model with primary school students in a classroom setting.The study found that employing the pedagogical approach of the 3C Model increased students' engagement levels and resulted in enhanced curriculum learning outcomes. Implications for practitioners: Without an age‐appropriate instructional sequencing model students may not be grasping the underlying concepts.Simply focusing on the code without emphasising concepts such as decomposition and algorithmic thinking will result in shallow learning.Key considerations in using the 3C Model are ensuring that conceptual development occurs using physical computing devices and language students are familiar with prior to introducing coding language and its symbolic representations.Primary school teachers should consider incorporating physical interactive digital devices, physical movement, staged language development and subsequent coding procedures within the context of an engaging and authentic problem. This approach enables students to effectively grasp and represent coding and computational thinking concepts and skills, surpassing mere procedural and rote learning.

Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students' understanding of programming's abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gamified Python programming was more beneficial to the development of pattern recognition and evaluation skills for boys and abstraction and decomposition skills for girls. This demonstrated the effectiveness of gamified Python programming to improve primary students' CT skills while clarifying the impact of gender and enriching research in the field of text-based programming.

However, as students transition to higher education, many encounter challenges with independent learning and research. This can negatively impact their Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), engagement, and practical expertise. This study introduces a solution: Computational Thinking Scaffolding (CTS) in the Jupyter Notebook environment, designed to enhance STEM education at the tertiary level. CTS incorporates five phases: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design, and Evaluation. Utilizing a quasi-experimental method, we assessed the impact of CTS on the HOTS, engagement, and practical skills of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Our findings hold substantial relevance for university educators, academic advisors, and curriculum designers aiming to enhance students' HOTS and hands-on capabilities in STEM disciplines. The results validate the effectiveness of CTS in elevating tertiary STEM learning outcomes, and they spotlight the adaptability of the Jupyter Notebook as a valuable tool in higher education. In conclusion, our research underscores the merits of CTS for improving outcomes in higher STEM education and sets a benchmark for future endeavors in this domain.

However, there is a lack of research on practice-based assignments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) projects, that allow undergraduate students to design and demonstrate educational robots using digital or physical assistance, especially when it comes to computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development in association with their psycho-emotional experience. This study compares the impact of Scratch and LEGO® WeDo robotic kits on students' CT and programming skills development. A quasi-experimental approach was conducted, involving two hundred forty-six participants (n = 246), who were equally divided between Scratch and LEGO® WeDo groups. Results indicate that the LEGO® WeDo group showed greater improvement in CT and programming skills development, while designing and presenting IoT projects. Nevertheless, no significant association between motivation, grit, and CT skills was observed. The findings highlight the potential of tangible robotics in facilitating students' hands-on learning and enhancing motivation to foster CT and programming skills. This study provides a wide range of implications for instructional designers on how to use tangible robotics to support hands-on IoT projects in computer science courses.

In this study, a total of 32 fifth graders worked on Scratch tasks in 16 pairs. The group discourse of three learning topics (comprising 9 projects) was collected. After the audio files were transcribed, 1,303 conversations were obtained. They were analyzed via Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) Webkit, which can reveal the trajectory of students' CT development via analyzing codes of discourse related to CT in PP. Three Scratch learning topics were assessed based on the Dr. Scratch platform to acquire the level of students' CT and to determine the low- and high-scoring groups. Results indicated that CT concepts and CT practices were always closely related in PP and CT practices, and CT perspectives could be gradually and closely related after a long period of CT training. A significant difference between the two groups' CT structures was found. The high-scoring group had more fragments of CT practice and connecting of CT perspectives, while the low-scoring group showed more fragments of CT concepts and expressing of CT perspectives. This research provides insights into cultivating primary school students' CT using Scratch in the context of PP. The findings can provide suggestions for instructors to design instructional interventions to facilitate students' CT skills via PP learning. Instructors can improve CT skills by guiding students to constantly ask questions, and specifying the role swap between driver and navigator in PP. Besides, instructors could give more consideration to the development of CT perspectives, and especially the ability to question.

Coding tools like robotic toys and tablet apps have become popular in early childhood education to support CT development, but there is a debate on which tool is more effective. Little evidence exists on the effect of coding on children's Social-Emotional Competence (SEC), which is crucial for lifelong development and extends beyond cognitive development. This experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two 9-week programs on promoting 73 preschool children's CT and SEC, one using coding robots and the other using coding apps. The results showed that children who participated in the Coding Robot Program had higher CT scores than those in the Coding App Program, after controlling for age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and baseline CT scores. While the SEC scores showed no substantial disparities between the groups, it was revealed that the initial performance levels moderated the intervention effects on emotional regulation and overall SEC. This suggests that the Coding Robot Program could be especially advantageous for a subset of children who initially have difficulties with emotional regulation and social skills. Implications of this study are presented for research and practice.

Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students' learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students' programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students' programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students' perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students' germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load. This study could be a notable reference for designing other courses in conjunction with programming learning activities.

This article examines a number of MBG to identify those that contain CT-promoting mechanics. We focus on MBG whose mechanics can implicitly support the development of CT, considering these games as valuable pedagogical tools for use in the classroom. Specifically, they can be used by groups of students to introduce, discuss and practice CT concepts. The research identifies several games considered ideal for achieving the aims of the PhD study. This article essentially explores the mechanics of carefully selected MBG, reflecting on how they integrate, support or relate to the development of CT, and discusses their implementation in educational contexts. The results suggest a practical approach to the selection of CT-promoting MBG, offering valuable insight for teachers and education professionals interested in using board games in education. The results point to the potential of these games as effective resources for developing CT in primary school students, contributing to both academic research and practical applications in education.

In the field of higher education, cultivating the ability of computational thinking has become an important goal of teaching. Previous research has shown that students' learning engagement is related to partial dimensions within computational thinking. However, there was a lack of research on the overall relationship between learning engagement and computational thinking. Therefore, this study aims at constructing an overall relationship model between learning engagement and computational thinking to examine the influence of three dimensions of learning engagement on the five dimensions of computational thinking. The participants were 341 freshmen from central China. The results show that compared with behavioral engagement, both emotional engagement and cognitive engagement had a stronger predictive power for computational thinking. In addition, the learning environment played a significant role in the relationship between learning engagement and computational thinking. On the whole, when compared with traditional multimedia classrooms, the relationship between learning engagement and computational thinking in smart classrooms was closer. A theoretical and empirical study of the relationship between learning engagement and computational thinking presents researchers and education practitioners with a method to improve students' computational thinking by building a learning environment and designing pedagogy.

In addition, this article considers that patterns of self-similarity in many problem domains have made many such solutions naturally representable as holarchies. Likewise, the increasing need for autonomous local decision making as well as the demand to produce solutions at scale has increased the relevance of the multi-agent paradigm to the creation of modern software systems. A variety of software development patterns are explored for their compatibility with holonic multi-agency. The current skill sets required by software development workers and concomitant training activities focus on instilling computational thinking abilities, a set of related cognitive competencies useful in the development of such systems. Intelligent systems play an increasingly important role in modern development and often benefit from computational intelligence techniques for the purpose of parameter tuning. This position paper explores the intersections between holonic multi-agency, modern information systems development, the computational intelligence which train them and the computational thinking skills those developers should be trained in.

However, there are few researches on the CT evaluation about undergraduates, and nor do a theoretical framework. Additionally, it is not clear what factors may affect their CT development. Therefore, according to Marzano's new taxonomy of educational objectives, this study constructed a theoretical framework for the CT evaluation, which included the field of the CT knowledge and the CT system. Then a Computational thinking scale (CTS) among 737 undergraduates was verified. CTS was adopted to evaluate undergraduates' CT skills, and the factors that may affect their CT skills are discussed according to the framework. The results showed that: (1) the CTS had sufficient reliability and validity among the sample undergraduates; (2) the CT skills of the sample undergraduates were in the middle and upper level (M = 15.71, SD = 2.18); (3) personal factors (gender and major) and contextual factors (educational environment and school support) are related to undergraduates' CT skills. Several suggestions and countermeasures were put forward for the undergraduates' CT cultivation on the framework, which will provide a reference for CT in undergraduate education.

Almost all research related to computational thinking mentions problem solving. Although some research has been conducted on computational thinking, few studies examined the impact of personal traits on students' computation thinking skills and problem solving. This study modeled cooperative attitudes of programming, learning style, self-regulation, and enjoyment as its key elements, investigated personal traits as predictors of problem-solving skills, and examined the correlation between variables and computational thinking. The 252 research participants were all sixth-grade students in an elementary school in Taipei, Taiwan. After a 10-week experimental curriculum, a posttest was conducted, and a total of 244 observations were collected. Correlation and regression analyses show that computational thinking is positively correlated with problem-solving skills, and learning style has the predictive ability for computational thinking. Furthermore, cooperative attitude and self-regulation of programming are important variables for predicting problem-solving skills; the degree of students' enjoyment in the curriculum will affect the cooperative attitude and self-regulation of their programming. In summary, the personal traits above could improve the participants' problem-solving skills hierarchically and help them achieve better computational thinking.

This study aims to look at the efficacy of private after-school extracurricular robotics activities, controlling fluid intelligence (Gf), a determining aspect in solving novel problems. A sample of 112 fifth-grade Spanish students was chosen, who completed two tests, the computational thinking test (CTt) (Román-González, 2016) and the KBIT fluid intelligence subtest (Kaufman, 1990). The results showed a great influence of Gf on the prediction of CT and significant differences between the students that had not attended after-school extracurricular classes and those that had attended for two or more years. Thus, this study substantiates the effectiveness of private extracurricular classes in promoting CT in the long term. Given the importance of CT nowadays, legislators should consider to include CT in compulsory education because private extracurricular classes could promote inequity.

Although some research has been conducted on computational thinking, few studies examined the impact of learning activities on students' computation thinking skills from the perspective of cognitive development. Based on the theory of scaffolding instruction, a progressive thinking training approach with flowcharts was proposed to cultivate students' computational thinking skills. A quasi-experiment was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Forty-nine Chinese tertiary students undertaking a programming course were randomly assigned into two groups – the experimental and control groups. During the course, the experimental group received progressive training, and the control group received non-progressive training. The results showed that the experimental group gained a significantly higher level of academic achievement than the control group. Meanwhile, the experimental group showed a remarkable improvement in programming self-efficacy. Furthermore, the participants in the experimental group showed a higher level of computational thinking skills, including cooperative learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. In summary, the progressive thinking training approach with flowcharts could not only improve the participants' computational thinking skills and programming self-efficacy, but also help them to achieve better academic outcomes.

An experimental design was used with 64 students; divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used a DBL approach with worksheets aimed at students designing their own final product design, while the control group was taught by the traditional approach with worksheets for redoing, practicing and designing their final product. Pre and posttests were used for data collection and evaluation scheme developed to score the final product. The finding showed no significant difference in the development of computational thinking between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in designing the final product between the two groups.

At present, academia either considers cognitive skills a part of computational thinking, or investigates the correlation between computational thinking and cognitive skills. Current research on computational thinking focuses on the design of teaching models to improve computational thinking ability and on measures for evaluating computational thinking. The association of computational thinking with motor skills is rarely discussed. From the perspective of embodied cognition theory, an association must exist, but its mechanisms have not been studied. Therefore, this study explores the effect of the teaching model of creative problem solving (CPS) on computational thinking and its internal correlation with technical skills. It was found that CPS can not only improve the computational thinking ability of students majoring in engineering, but also promote their corresponding motor skills. However, the students' previous academic background had a certain influence on their learning outcomes. Students at universities of technology experienced a greater improvement in their computational thinking and motor skills than students at general universities. There is a certain correlation between computational thinking and motor skills, and the interaction between them should be properly considered in future teaching and curriculum design so as to improve students' learning effectiveness.

The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students' preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed.

The neuro-computerized virtual learning environments (NCVLE) model was designed to be used to teach the mechanics course to third-year students of the mathematics department. To achieve the targeted learning outcomes, the study recruited (102) third-year students of the Faculty of Education and classified them into a control group of (50) students and an experimental group of (52) students. The experiment lasted for 14 weeks during one semester of the 2021-2022 academic year. The results agreed with most of what has been found from relevant literature and studies. Also, the results indicated that the NCVLE model played a vital role in the purposeful teaching, learning, and assessment processes and enhanced the learning of computational thinking.

However, practicing computational thinking through programming is dependent on the problem solvers' metacognition. This study investigated students' metacognitive planning and problem-solving performance in programming through two quantitative studies. First, we analyzed the performance of metacognitive planning and of problem solving through the programming of 21 freshmen, and found that the metacognitive planning performance related to ""problem description"" and ""program comprehension"" was significantly correlated with problem-solving performance. Second, semi-scaffolding and full-scaffolding were designed based on the first study. Another 89 freshmen were randomly divided into three groups and were asked to write their programming plan with no-scaffolding, semi-scaffolding, or with full-scaffolding. ANCOVA revealed that the problem-solving performance of the no-scaffolding group was significantly weaker than that of the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the semi-scaffolding and the full-scaffolding groups. The study indicated that semi-scaffolding had a similar effect to full-scaffolding on problem-solving performance. The study suggests that teachers should emphasize supporting students' ""problem description"" and ""program comprehension"" using semi-scaffolding. This scaffolding technique is sufficient and efficient for training students' computational thinking through problem solving in programming.

While the majority of existing studies on developing students' CT skills have been based on competency or personality factors, social factors have been largely ignored. Objectives: This systematic review, framed by social cognitive learning theories, aims to unravel the influencing factors of collaboration in developing computational thinking skills in K‐12 education. Methods: We searched four databases and located 79 publications for synthesis analysis to identify 10 social cognitive factors from personal and learning environmental perspectives. Personal factors are gender, prior knowledge, and motivational attitudes, while the learning environmental factors are roles, partnership, interaction, culture, tools, tasks, and scaffolding. Results and Conclusions: We examined the following five major issues: (a) collaboration elements designed in learning activities; (b) social cognitive factors that might influence the development of computational thinking; (c) the influences caused by social cognitive factors; (d) students' perceived benefits of collaboration; (e) major challenges of integrating collaboration in computational thinking education. The most reported challenges in collaborative classrooms are students' misunderstanding of computational thinking knowledge, negative sentiments, and communication problems. Accordingly, a design framework to facilitate collaborative learning activities was proposed. The design framework can provide a more focused research avenue for examining the effects of collaboration in the development of computational thinking in K‐12 education. Lay Description: What is already known about the topic?: Collaboration has commonly been integrated in computational thinking (CT) education to foster novice learning in K‐12 education.There have been disputes regarding the effectiveness of collaboration in achieving learning outcomes.There is a need for further examination of the influencing factors of collaboration, which might influence students' CT performances. What does this paper add?: Our review identified personal factors (i.e., gender, prior knowledge, and motivational attitudes) and learning environmental factors (i.e., roles, partnership, interaction, culture, tools, tasks, and scaffolding), and revealed their influences in students' CT performances in K‐12 education.The synthesis of students' authentic opinions can yield insights to the possible mechanism of how collaboration can bring benefits to students' CT performances.The design framework generated from the review can shed lights on design an effective learning environment which integrates collaboration in K‐12 CT education. Implications for practice and/or policy?: The collaborative learning process of CT is complex, whereby the effects of social cognitive factors do not stand‐alone but are influenced by personal and learning environmental factors simultaneously.Taking the identified challenges of students, instructors, and operation can help smooth organization of collaborative learning activities of K‐12 CT education.Future students could look more in‐depth into the impacts of the social and situation factors in developing CT.

Objectives: This study explores the relationships between students' learning performance, focusing on computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development, in association with their cognitive load (mental load and mental effort) and emotions (happiness, anger, anxiety, sadness) by playing SGs. Methods: A total of two hundred and ninety participants (n = 290) in fifth‐grade classes (10–11 years old) of Greek primary schools completed all pre‐and post‐intervention tests. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted over a 14‐week timetable course and in two comparison conditions, in which a SG was created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL and Scratch for the experimental group (n = 145) and the control group (n = 145), respectively. To further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SG in each teaching intervention, an exploration of relationships between students' learning performance, cognitive load, and emotions through multiple analyses, depending on correlation, t‐tests, correlation, and hierarchal regression was delivered. Results and Conclusions: The findings indicate that the proposed SG created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL positively affected students' emotions and cognitive load, whereas there was no significant difference in learning gain between the two groups. Implications: The study provides empirical evidence on the effects of SGs on students' knowledge acquisition, highlighting the importance of considering both cognitive and emotional components in the design of these games. The findings also offer valuable insights for implications policy and practice. Lay Description: What is already known: Interactive environments can support the development of students' computational thinking (CT) and programming skills due to a wide range of digital elements/features that expand the boundaries where learning can happen.CT is a 21st‐century skill to be on top with others, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic for future generations of students to tackle real‐life problems.Despite a broad consensus on the increasing number of interactive environments, there is no dedicated measurement of their effects on students' performance and their possible association with psychological constructs. What this paper adds: This study explores any possible relationships amongst students' CT skills, emotions, and cognitive load for programming courses in fifth‐grade (10–11 years old) classes of primary education by playing a simulation game (SG).The proposed SG was created by using two interactive environments that project different 2D/3D user interface and game elements (e.g., special effects, scenes, animations, feedback, challenges, goal clarity, and scripted interaction).A quasi‐experimental study was conducted over a 14‐week timetable course and in two comparison conditions, in which the proposed SG was created by using OpenSimulator&Scratch4SL and Scratch for the experimental group (n = 145) and the control group (n = 145), respectively. Implications for practice and/or policy: In‐game scenario and students' embodied experiences can increase CT vocabulary acquisition, understanding, and expression of solution plans via visual coding.A practical roadmap for practitioners and instructors proposed how to purposefully integrate elements/features into interactive environments.Problem‐solving exercises in a simulated reality can become interesting and reduce students' cognitive load, when they are taking part in enjoyable and playful settings.

Objectives: To fill the gap in knowledge, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a web‐based parent education program on improving children's CT skills. Additionally, we sought to determine if children's age, gender and family socioeconomic status had any impact on the development of CT skills. Methods: We selected 86 adult–child pairs in the K3 age group to participate in a 4‐week intervention program using a quasi‐experimental approach. Results: After 4 weeks, children in the intervention group had improved their CT skills more than their peers in the control group. This shows that the intervention was successful in enhancing children's CT skills. Age had a moderating effect on CT enhancement, with older children showing a more significant improvement than younger children. However, children's gender and family socioeconomic status did not have any moderating effects. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CT education can be effectively implemented in the home setting through web‐mediated parent education. Encouraging the use of unplugged CT activities at home can aid children in acquiring CT skills. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) education can be started at the early childhood stage.Both plugged‐in and unplugged activities can promote children's CT.Unplugged activities have many advantages and are suitable for young children. What this paper adds: Web‐mediated parent education is useful for equipping parents with the knowledge and skills to conduct CT activities at home.CT education has a positive effect on children in the home setting.Parents play an important leading role in children's CT education.Parent–child unplugged activities are beneficial to children's CT enhancement. Implications for practice and/or policy: A web‐mediated approach is an appropriate way to encourage parent participation in CT training.CT‐related parent education should be scaled up so that parents can play an active educational role at home.Unplugged CT activities should be designed more for the home settings in addition to school settings.

This study employed a quasi-experimental design to address this gap, involving 64 secondary school students in two groups. For the beginning five weeks, the first group used an introductory block-based programming environment, while the second group used an introductory text-based programming environment. Then, both groups transitioned to professional text-based programming for the subsequent eight weeks. The results showed that participants who transitioned from introductory text-based programming to professional text-based programming (1) significantly outperformed in computational thinking skills; (2) had more code-writing and debugging behaviors and fewer irrelevant behaviors, and (3) had more interactions with the instructor. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding enjoyment, confidence, and interest in programming. Drawing on these findings, this study proposes pedagogical implications that could facilitate the adoption of programming modalities within the broader context of STEM education.

Various strategies have been planned and developed to help in introducing, improving, and delivering CT. One of the strategies is by creating and developing the supporting tools for CT learning. In this article, educational robotics (ER) is chosen as the focus tool to support CT learning. Each CT and ER has a massive field of study. There are various available reports determining the suitability of CT subject integrated with ER for students' learning. However, all students do not develop similar style of learning and thinking. There is difference in their personal traits. There is a lack of research that designed CT learning through ER specifically based on student's preferences. Besides, it resulted in a challenge to determine the suitability of CT and ER for different kind of preferences. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an adaptive learning (AL) framework for students to deliver learning of CT through ER. The framework consists of three submodels: domain model, student model, and adaptation model. One case study is defined, which is learning the introductory level of CT through ER (CTER). At the end of the study, it can be observed that the AL framework produced positive results in performance and perception for various student categories. It was noted that students utilizing the AL framework had superior understanding of CTER. Individually or collaboratively, all students who applied or did not apply the AL framework in studying the CTER introduction had positive learning outcomes.

Different from child–robot interactions as investigated in the social robot field, student–robot (S–R) interactions focus mainly on the process of interaction between learners and programmable robot kits in RE settings. At a four-week robotics summer camp in China, mixed-methods research was conducted. Forty primary school students and one dedicated robotics teacher participated in this research, while 32 students and the teacher completed all the lessons and data collection procedures of the summer camp. Results indicated that students' CT skill increased during the summer camp and that the change in their CT skill was positively correlated to the time spent on S–R interaction. Additionally, how three kinds of S–R interaction—programming-computing, observational investigation, and participatory investigation—cultivated students' CT were found. Moreover, the hierarchy of three S–R interactions and students' role-shifting in the hierarchy were discussed. Previous studies rarely discussed S–R interaction; however, this kind of interaction should be explored because it provides more information about students' natural learning process, which might be meaningful to RE practice.

The study was conducted with 84 second graders using a quasi-experimental design. The students' attitudes towards technology were measured before and after the intervention using the Pupils' Attitudes Toward Technology test. The results indicate that CT instruction improves children's attitudes towards technology and narrows the gender gap, regardless of the approach. The inclusion of formal activities for CT can have beneficial effects beyond this learning. The reduction of the gender gap in technology at these ages is a fundamental issue for the promotion of scientific vocations among girls.

This framework, which can be applied to any subject at the elementary school level, is grounded on specific principles that we have gleaned from both learning theories and considerations on child development. New media literacy skills (NML) and social-emotional skills are also targeted, as they are strongly connected with CT skills and display bidirectional linkages that can comprehensively benefit students in various ways (cognitively, imaginatively/creatively, materially, socially, and affectively/emotionally) without the need for digital technologies or coding. The universal nature of our curricular proposal rests on the following factors: it is based on a cross-disciplinary approach that can be applied in ways that mirror real life; CT is seen as a universal skill that should be learned by everyone, not just computer scientists, and is applicable to every aspect of daily life; one-sided intellectualism is avoided; and, lastly, the resulting classroom practices have an impact on and are influenced by children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.

This study reported a meta-analysis of 22 empirical studies to determine the effectiveness of using educational games to improve students' CT skills and the influence of various factors in instructional design on acquiring CT skills. The results showed that: (a) educational games can promote the improvement of students' CT skills (Hedges' g = 0.766, p = 0.000); (b) the overall effect is at the upper-middle level (95%CI [0.580, 0.951]); (c) The positive connection between educational games and CT skills is affected by sample size, grades level, game usage mode, and game tools. Controlling the class size to less than 50 students and the reasonable choice of game tools and usage modes are more conducive to promoting students' CT skills. In sum, we suggested that the educational game teaching process should be rationally planned, and technology should be fully utilized to develop students' CT skills. The above findings are of great significance to promote the improvement of students' CT skills through educational games in the future.

For this purpose, an explanatory sequential mixed‐method research design was used. In this research design, a qualitative data collection process follows a quantitative one to be able to further explain the novel results obtained through analysis of the quantitative data. In the quantitative part, a quasiexperimental study was designed, and one experimental group (EG) and one control group (CG) were formed randomly. The study was conducted with sixth‐grade middle school students for 14 weeks. In the process, students were given project tasks based on some real‐life problems, and they were asked to transfer their programming skills. It was preferred to use mBot as an ER. While the EG students performed programming activities with the mBot, the CG students performed only block‐based programming activities. Both groups were given pre‐ and posttests to collect data. Finally, semistructured interviews were conducted with the EG students to enrich quantitative findings. The results showed that robotics programming activities increased the students' programming success and transfer of learning, and scores of the EG were significantly higher than the CG. In addition, it was determined that both the EG and CG students' CT skills increased, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Finally, most of the students reported positive views on the use of ER in programming education.

Therefore, there is a need for more evidence with regards to a theoretical and practical understanding of CT skills' development of K‐12 students. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of an unplugged coding course on primary school students' development of CT skills, differences in their CT skills in terms of socio‐demographics such as gender, computer ownership, daily computer use, and home Internet access, and the relationship between their CT and 21st century skills. Methods: The research was based a quasi‐experimental design with one‐group pretest‐posttest with follow‐up. The CT skills of 212 third and fourth grade students at a public primary school of Turkey were measured with a CT Skills Test before, after, and about ten weeks following having attended an unplugged coding course. Results and Conclusions: The results of the study showed that the unplugged coding course statistically significantly improved the participants' CT skills, specifically in algorithmic design, abstraction, evaluation, decomposition, and generalization. Moreover, the findings indicated that primary school students' CT skills were not associated with their socio‐demographics. In addition, the students' CT skills were found to be positively and statistically significantly correlated with their collaboration and communication skills. Implications: This study contributes to understanding of the effects of unplugged activities on the development of primary school students' CT skills, which is beneficial to teaching practices for CT skills in the primary education.

On the one hand, this brings us to analyze the relations and intersections between different process of thought (analytical, logical, mathematical, system, engineering, algorithmic) and the role of search for simplicity, generalization, and scalability in the layers of abstraction in Computational Thinking. On the other hand, we explore the roots and the discursive environment of authors that could contribute to this conceptualizing process in the years around its popularization following Jeannette Wing's founding article in 2006. We have also included in our analysis the points of convergence with Seymour Papert's work related to the computer-machine seen as an ""object-to-think-with"" helping to the construction of knowledge from an epistemological perspective to the computing-human. Even though a consensus on the definition of the concept has not yet ben encountered, the analysis helps to highlight the solid reference points that address what is at the core of Computational thinking and what should be the framework of educational interventions and research that revolve around it.

One of the distance learning media that was carried out during the pandemic was using the Learning Management System (LMS). Not only that, a policy evaluation needs to be carried out to evaluate the distance learning system that has been implemented in universities. This is because technology-based distance learning requires a different approach in terms of planning, implementation and evaluation. To increase the effectiveness of learning can use the assessment for learning (AfL) model. The learning process is also expected to be in accordance with learning that directs to have a computational thinking approach which is much needed considering that problem solving skills are needed in solving everyday problems. Based on the results of data analysis with 4D development model (define, design, develop, and disseminate), learning management system based on assessment for learning to improve computational thinking abilities got an average score of 85.2, which means it can be implemented well.

It has the capability to combine both digital and reality world that subsequently leads to the emergence of new possibilities in improving the quality of teaching and learning activities. The objective of this research is mainly to analyse the Computational thinking elements in solving Geometry topic after the intervention of AR application. Qualitative data analysis was employed as the research methodology of this study that involved interview protocol with 10 pupils enrolled in Form 1 Mathematics class at one of the selected schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Content analysis was then administered using the ATLAS.Ti Version 8 software to identify the codes, themes, and meaning conveyed by the pupils' answers in the Computational thinking test. Based on the interview and Computational thinking assessment show the pupils' ability to solve Geometrical problems using Computational thinking elements. The researcher found that Computational thinking elements do exist in problem solving pertaining to the topic of Geometry. However, the order of usage of these Computational thinking elements differs among the pupils. This leads to the conclusion that pupils who utilise the AR application with Computational thinking successfully solve Geometrical problems through the help of the Geometrical thinking process that comprises the elements of Abstraction, Generalisation, Decomposition, Algorithmic, and Debugging.

Decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design are four major components of computational thinking. We conducted an experiment to study the effectiveness of smartphone apps for teaching computational thinking to 7‐year‐old children. The first experimental group was taught computational thinking using four apps, one for each component. The second experimental group was taught computational thinking using the chalk and board approach. The control group was not imparted any lesson in computational thinking. The intervention period lasted 8 weeks and was followed by a posttest and a retention test conducted after another 2 weeks. The children showed interest in learning computational thinking and could solve problems that are inspired by real‐world engineering problems during the intervention period. They could analyze and debug (77%) their own work. The performance of the children in the two experiment groups was significantly better than those in the control group in the posttest and the retention test (F = 26.470, p <.05). This means that 7‐year‐old children can learn computational thinking from suitable mediums. No significant difference was observed in the performance of the children in the posttest and the retention test (p >.05), denoting that children can retain the concepts of computational thinking. Including computational thinking lessons at the K‐12 level can encourage children to enroll in engineering programs in the future. We recommend standardization of content and development of age‐specific apps for teaching computational thinking.

Recent reports suggest that computational and engineering thinking can empower each other, and engineering design can be an appropriate context for children's engagement in computational thinking. Previous studies have documented young children's abilities to engage in engineering thinking and other studies have collected evidence of young children's abilities to engage in computational thinking. However, there is little research that explores how children's engagement in both engineering and computational thinking can support each other. Hence, in this qualitative case study, we aimed to examine how 5 to 7-year-old children engage in computational thinking competencies in the context of a family based engineering design activity. This activity was conducted at a small science center exhibit. In our presented findings we map children's enactment of at least one CT competency to children's engagement in engineering design actions.

However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (M age = 14.14 years, SD age = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool.

Utilizing Richey and Klein's design and development (DDR) methodologies, this research serves as a primer by first concentrating on needs analysis for the design, then converting it into the development of the board game. The focus of this study was on how the design aspects of Robobug might help children grasp CT principles and foster CT practices. The Robobug board game was initially assessed remotely via questionnaire by a panel of eight subject matter experts from Malaysian institutions. Using the questionnaire and evaluation rubrics, experts were asked to offer insights with the following objectives: (i) to evaluate the design features; (ii) to examine the computational concepts; and (iii) to examine the computational practices of the Robobug board game. The research found that the Robobug board game has significant potential for use as an unplugged tool and alternative technique for instructors to enhance CT abilities outside the typical classroom. Additionally, it can be utilized to incorporate collaborative and game-based learning into teachers' instructional strategies to boost student engagement and achievement. The Robobug board game's shortcomings and suggestions for improvement are discussed.

However, the lack of in‐depth research on the characteristics of college students' CT skills in text‐based programming learning has resulted in the unknown distribution characteristics and evolution patterns of their CT skills, which cannot effectively constitute an effective tracking analysis of their CT skills, thus affecting the cultivation of creative thinking and problem‐solving skills for them. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to explore the characteristics of college students' CT skills through text‐based programming work and discover the overall characteristics, individual differences and evolutionary patterns of their CT skills on the relation between text‐based programming and CT skills through data analysis. It was found that there are roughly five categories of CT difference and four major categories with nine subcategories of CT evolution among college students. The results showed that the Control and Data skills were the students' dominant skills. In contrast, Algorithm skills were relatively weak. Only about 1/3 of the students had the phenomenon of continuous skill improvement, and programming learning did not have a significant impact on the improvement of CT skills for some students. Finally, we propose several suggestions for CT skills development strategies in response to the students' characteristics in CT skills. The study can not only fill the gaps of the current study but also identify the evolutionary characteristics of students' CT skills, which can effectively intervene in college students' programming learning and help improve their CT skills.

This article presents essential findings of a case study of a Python programming contest with an automatic judgement system for Competitive Programming training extending the learning experiences for students in an introductory course, computational thinking and problem‐solving. The benefits and challenges are discussed. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic, a hybrid model of the contest was adopted, that is, some students participated in the contest on‐site, while others participated remotely. To alleviate human effort in judging the submissions, the DOMjudge platform, a web‐based automatic judgement system, has been deployed as an online automatic judgement system and contest management in competitive programming. The implementation roadmap and framework were provided. The contest problems and contestants' performances were discussed. Not many junior contestants could solve at least one problem(s), and competitive computing training should be offered if the students are keen on open competitions. An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the student feedback after the contest. Preliminary results revealed that the contest offering the chance to stimulate student learning interests could enhance their independent learning, innovative thinking and problem‐solving skills, and could thus lead to the overall benefits of the learning experiences, which further encourage them to participate in future contests to improve their learning and therefore enhance their employability. Employers often treasure student experiences in competitive programming events, like association for computing machinery programming contests, Google Code Jam or Microsoft Imagine Cup. Sharp vision requiring skills to tackle unseen problems within a short period is also instrumental to students planning for graduate school.

While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists' lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses.

Simulation is an essential tool for the optimization of valuable products. This work presents the rigorous simulation of a vacuum distillation unit (VDU) based on actual data from the vacuum distillation processes using Aspen HYSYS V10. The Peng–Robinson fluid package is used in this simulation, and an input assay with a standard density of 29 API_60 (879.8 kg/m3) is employed. True boiling point (TBP) assay data are the type that is being used. Methane, ethane, propane, i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane are the components listed in the simulation. The research determines that achieving a yield capacity of 685 tons/h requires thirty stages in the atmospheric distillation unit and twelve stages in the vacuum distillation unit while operating at 420 °C temperature and 9 kPa pressure. Adjustments in the flash section temperature (FST) and steam flow rate (SFR) are proposed to enhance operational efficiency. Increasing the FST from 370 °C to 400 °C and adjusting SFR from 10 tons/h to 26 tons/h increases the Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO) yield by 7.2% while elevating the FST from 400 °C to 430 °C and adjusting SFR from 10 tons/h to 26 tons/h enhances the High Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO) yield by 7.4%. These optimization strategies offer a practical and effective approach for refineries to improve the economic benefits of vacuum distillation units. The implications of this research can act as a computational thinking exercise for higher education students considering the case study where only through changing the operational strategies can the yield be enhanced by 10.81% in the vacuum distillation unit of the oil refinery.

One of these skills is computational thinking (CT), which is the ability to systematically think and solve problems in daily life. This research aims to ascertain the benefits of using a mobile cloud-based learning system with a peer-to-peer reverse engineering approach in enhancing CT skill. In this study, a cloud-based learning system and learning management plans were employed as research instruments, and a CT test was used as a data gathering instrument. The data were analyzed using the mean and standard deviation, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and t-test. The findings suggested that the students' scores were higher after using the cloud-based learning system, at a 0.05 level of significance. After performing the repeatedmeasures ANOVA, the students' scores were significantly higher at a 0.05 level in each round of the CT test. At the same time, peer learning increased the positive attitude of the learners toward the system and promoted the effectiveness of working in a team. This study provides a better understanding of the current research trends in the field of CT education, the perception of students, and the learning strategies and technology involved in CT education.

There has been an increasing interest in integrating computational thinking into STEM and many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of this intervention. This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students' STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57–1.14]; p <.001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.

The CT elements in this research focus on four major programming concepts, which are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We have conducted game activities through several algorithms that include sorting, swapping, and graph algorithms and analyzed how the game affects the student experience (SX) in understanding the CT concept in those algorithms. We have applied the quadrilateral method approach to the data collection and analysis. The data was obtained through observation, interview/survey based on six SX criteria (attention, engagement, awareness, satisfaction, confidence, and performance), and performances of the conducted game activities were compared. The results of the quadrilation of the data collected show a positive impact on the SX, highlight the effectiveness of the competitive, physical, and tactile game approach proposed in this research towards programming and CT skills development.

Effective learning environments are needed to incorporate computational thinking within the engineering disciplines. Design‐based research is uniquely positioned to address this need for designing effective learning environments. Purpose: This design‐based research study characterizes the different ways in which students used computational thinking when building computational models. The design of the model‐building activities was grounded in productive failure and model‐eliciting activities. Design: The design‐based research study implemented the computational modeling activities within an engineering capstone course. The research question was: What types of computational thinking outcomes emerge when engineering students build computational models? Thematic analysis was applied to individual student artifacts to identify key computational thinking outcomes that were elicited as a result of the intervention. Results: Throughout the building of the model, students demonstrated the use of computational thinking outcomes, mainly abstraction, algorithmic thinking, evaluation, generalization, and decomposition. However, the diversity and density of use for each outcome were different and unique. Conclusions: This study shows how building computational models, when guided by current educational theories, can allow for students to practice the use of computational thinking and for educators to incorporate these key practices into their engineering classrooms.

In this study, CT was operationalized in everyday problem-solving contexts in a learning experiment (n = 59) that investigated whether learning programming enhances students’ CT skills. Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes – discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students’ age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis. Implications of the inconclusive finding about the transfer of programming skills to CT are emphasized and the arguments for disentangling CT from programming are highlighted.

If we are to foster CT in areas like the humanities, we must extend our understanding of CT to include emergent and creative expressions of computational concepts. We explore the makerspace as a fertile environment for experimentation and play with CT concepts, which can then be extended through creative writing and imaginative extrapolation, during which learners metabolize and imaginatively project computational thinking beyond the confines of the actual and into rich potentiality.

Secondly, the design process of the teaching model and the problem-solving model of visual programming are studied. Finally, a deep learning (DL) evaluation model is constructed, and the effectiveness of the designed teaching model is analyzed and evaluated. The T-test result of paired samples of CT is t = −2.08, P < 0.05. There are significant differences in the results of the two tests, and the designed teaching model can cause changes in students' CT abilities. The results reveal that the effectiveness of the teaching model based on scratch modular programming has been verified on the basis of experiments. The post-test values of the dimensions of algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, collaborative thinking, and problem-solving thinking are all higher than the pretest values, and there are individual differences. The P values are all less than 0.05, which testifies that the CT training of the designed teaching model has the algorithm dimension, critical thinking, collaborative thinking, and problem-solving ability of students' CT. The post-test values of cognitive load are all lower than the pretest values, indicating that the model has a certain positive effect on reducing cognitive load, and there is a significant difference between the pretest and post-test. In the dimension of creative thinking, the P value is 0.218, and there is no obvious difference in the dimensions of creativity and self-efficacy. It can be found from the DL evaluation that the average value of the DL knowledge and skills dimensions is greater than 3.5, and college students can reach a certain standard level in terms of knowledge and skills. The mean value of the process and method dimensions is about 3.1, and the mean value of the emotional attitudes and values is 2.77. The process and method, as well as emotional attitude and values, need to be strengthened. The DL level of college students is relatively low, and it is necessary to improve their DL level from the perspective of knowledge and skills, processes and methods, emotional attitudes and values. This research makes up for the shortcomings of traditional programming and design software to a certain extent. It has a certain reference value for researchers and teachers to carry out programming teaching practice.

The objective of the study was to describe competitiveness from complex and rhizomatic thinking through non-computational data science engineering. The study was conducted from July to December 2022 where the analysis of the regional competitiveness index (INCORE) published by the Peruvian Institute of Economics for the Southern Macro Region of Peru from 2017 to 2021 was considered. The criteria of complex and rhizomatic thinking were based on the pillars and measurement indicators on regional competitiveness and the rhizomatic model of interpretation on regional competitiveness. It is described, that each indicator does not interact with others, and at the same time does not impact by others. The conception as a product and producer oriented to social growth was not observed. Therefore, it is considered that there was a limitation on the evidence of realities for the fulfillment of development, from dimensions and variables based on social and human welfare.

Computational thinking is the process of abstracting and automating a variety of problems using computational technology. A system that expresses, manages, and processes knowledge such as computational thinking is called a knowledge-based system. This paper proposes to examine students' knowledge about computational thinking when they want to develop a Python project, and the correlation/association between these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from a computer programming lecture. Through this data analysis, we try to identify the factors through the correlation between data and clustering technique in order to express and discover the knowledge about the learner's computational thinking. For the verification of the factors identified, we analyzed the correlation between computational thinking and the pre- and post-test results of the LightBot. In addition to the regression analysis of the proven factors, the probability of the research model was analyzed through the structural equation to process the knowledge discovered. In this paper, we present various problems in the domain of programming education and analyze the means to diagnose and improve knowledge based on computational thinking by finding various problem-solving methods. To pre-examine the learner; he/she was diagnosed using a test paper and the LightBot execution test. We checked the learner's current knowledge state by analyzing the correlation between the test site and the results of the LightBot. To analyze the level of knowledge improvement of learners, we designed an experiment to analyze the correlation between learning and the actual test results through a system that applied the problem-solving learning method. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that there was a correlation between the test results for a learner and the pre-test results of the LightBot. Additionally, the group mean scores of the learners who learned as per the proposed technique were observed to be significant. During this process, we analyzed the effects of problem-solving and system application on academic achievement through factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The ability to pinpoint various problem scenarios and solve problems more effectively using computational technologies will become more important in future. For this purpose, applying our proposed technique for deriving and improving knowledge based on computational thinking to software education will induce the interest of students and increase the learning effect.

Digital twins have the potential to revolutionize education by offering immersive and interactive learning experiences. They can simulate virtual environments, enabling students to conduct experiments, practice techniques, and observe outcomes in a safe and cost-effective setting, particularly when access to physical laboratories is limited or expensive. This work proposes a learning management model that applies cognitive apprenticeship learning theory as a framework for learning digital twins to enhance the programming of a smart agriculture system and computational thinking skills. The model consists of three parts: input, learning process, and output with feedback. The input phase includes setting learning objectives, analyzing learners, determining learning content, planning learning activities, and utilizing a digital twin virtual laboratory space for experimenting in the development of a smart agriculture system. The learning process involves engaging students in programming and problem-solving tasks by offering expert guidance and support in computationally solving problems. The achievement of learning outcomes and practices is included in the output and feedback sections. After evaluation, five experts in this subject agreed that the learning management model was at the most appropriate level.

Currently, there is a lack of such assessments in upper primary school. That is why we present the development and validation of the competent CT test (cCTt), an unplugged CT test targeting 7–9 year-old students. In the first phase, 37 experts evaluated the validity of the cCTt through a survey and focus group. In the second phase, the test was administered to 1519 students. We employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to assess the instruments' psychometric properties. The expert evaluation indicates that the cCTt shows good face, construct, and content validity. Furthermore, the psychometric analysis of the student data demonstrates adequate reliability, difficulty, and discriminability for the target age groups. Finally, shortened variants of the test are established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. To conclude, the proposed cCTt is a valid and reliable instrument, for use by researchers and educators alike, which expands the portfolio of validated CT assessments across compulsory education. Future assessments looking at capturing CT in a more exhaustive manner might consider combining the cCTt with other forms of assessments.

Instructional approaches to CT development and assessment in the field of computer science have attracted global attention, but the influence of CT skills on other subject areas is under‐researched. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the transfer effects of CT in different subject areas and examine the educational characteristics of CT intervention approaches that promote the transfer of learning. Method: We carefully selected and reviewed 55 empirical studies from leading bibliographic databases and examined the transfer of CT using a meta‐analysis and a qualitative synthesis. Results and Conclusions: We identified and summarized these effects in the fields of mathematics, science, engineering and the humanities. A meta‐analysis of these studies identified a generally significant effect of the transfer of CT skills to other subject areas. We also explored the characteristics of CT interventions that aid the transfer of learning by qualitatively assessing the identified studies. The results of the review offer a holistic view of the trends in CT transfer research that can be used as a reference for both researchers and instructors. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) has been developed into cross‐disciplinary literacy and can lead to innovations in various academic fields.There is a need for a systematic understanding of the transfer effects of CT to improve the influence of CT and promote CT integration across domains. What this paper adds: Our review identified several subject areas beyond computer science in which the transfer effects of CT were observed.Our analysis revealed that the transfer of CT has a significant positive effect on students' learning in areas beyond computer science.Our review synthesized a series of intervention guidelines that can promote the transfer of learning in CT education. Implications for practitioners: Research on the transfer of CT in engineering and non‐STEM domains is required for a more comprehensive understanding of CT skills.Instructional design in CT education should attend to the facilitation of the transfer of learning to maximize the benefits of CT acquisition.

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking.

In tradition instruction, PFCT (problem identification, flow definition, coding, and testing) is a commonly adopted procedure to guide students to learn and practice computer programming. However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students' computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students' learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students' computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores.

Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner's activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed.

Second, apply computational thinking to further characterize the system model. From the point of view of mining frequent item sets, this paper constructs an analysis model of product innovation intention from a microscopic perspective and makes a correlation analysis of innovation and demand, providing technical support for the combination and screening of innovation and demand. The model runs in a Python environment. This study uses the Apriori algorithm to improve the efficiency of frequent set mining. This model has no specific restrictions on the selected users, the way to select demand data is broad, and the data are easy to obtain. The use of large amounts of data for analysis also reduces the bias of experts and leading users in evaluating and screening innovation intentions. The simulation of the operation and screening efficiency of the product innovation intention analysis model shows that (1) the model runs effectively. (2) The number of innovation intentions screened by the model can be regulated by adjusting only two variables: min_support and min_confidence. However, the number of strong association rules is more sensitive to the adjustment of min_support.

It has been the elements of competency expected of the next generation of talents. However, the current research on computational thinking evaluation is still at a relatively weak stage. The existing related evaluation research is still limited to traditional curriculum evaluation methods. Therefore, the training effect of computational thinking cannot be well quantified, and the characteristics of students cannot be further explored. In this work, we propose a three-way decision model for improving computation thinking. We first developed a system of evaluation metrics, including five specific primary indicators and several secondary indicators. Next, the weight of each indicator was determined by applying an expert similarity measure, consequently getting the best metric sequence. We employ a grey correlation analysis to calculate the distance of each test result from this optimal sequence. Then, we trisect the set of testers based on the distance to build three regions of high score sequences, medium score sequences, and low score sequences inspired by the three-way decision. We can then exploit these rules on target students in the relatively low regions to improve their computational thinking. An example analysis illustrates the effectiveness and applicability of the method. This article provides a solid theoretical basis for improving students' computational thinking ability. Teaching administrators can conveniently formulate computational thinking teaching strategies, and timely warning and intervention for students with poor computational thinking ability can effectively improve students' computational thinking ability. The corresponding training measures are given to students of different ability levels to achieve differentiated and personalized training.

The establishment of family education relationship plays an important role in the activity process and effect of family education and will have a profound impact on children's physical and mental development. The study of family education relationship is an important issue that cannot be ignored in the study of family education theory. In order to enhance the effectiveness of family education, it is an objective requirement of theory and practice to rationally analyze and optimize the contemporary family education relationship from the perspective of communication theory. The introduction of communication theory into the field of family education will help to change the actual situation of lack of communication and barrier in contemporary family education relationship and also provide a new idea and perspective for the research and solution of other related problems in family education. Starting from the research and discussion of the basic theory of the relationship between communication and family education, this paper analyzes the concept and characteristics of family education relationship in detail, analyzes and examines the family education relationship in history, and establishes a basic understanding of family education relationship. On the basis of the research of the relevant basic theories, the paper explores and analyzes the current situation and reasons of the lack of communication and the blocking of the contemporary family education relationship. From the perspective of communication, it investigates the contemporary family-educational relationship, clarifies that the basic structure of the family-educational relationship is the unity of the internal interpersonal organizational relationship structure, the psychological relationship structure, and the activity process structure, and examines the current situation of the basic structure one by one. This paper proposes that, with the development of the times and society, the contemporary family education relationship has a huge development compared with the historical family education relationship, reflecting the characteristics of the times such as democracy, but there is still a lack of communication and barriers. Then it analyzes the various concrete manifestations of the lack of communication and the blocking situation in the contemporary family education relationship and its adverse consequences to family education. This paper verifies the influence of computational thinking on the optimization mechanism of family education and demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of computational thinking in family education. This optimizes the family education mechanism from the perspective of computational thinking and provides a research case with reference value for follow-up research.

To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers' perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of ""what is CT?"" and ""how is it evidenced?"".

Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students' CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students' understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.

Objectives: This critical, integrative review synthesizes teacher learning literature about the role of computational literacy and computing practices in K‐12 science teaching. Methods: We examined 54 peer‐reviewed articles and analysed the ways the researchers and teacher participants describe the affordances of integrating computational thinking (CT) and other computational practices in science. We characterize how CT and computational practices are framed in relation to scientific learning goals. We identify six primary affordances for integrating computational practices with science that are conveyed to teachers and by teachers, as represented in these studies of teacher learning. Results and Conclusions: These six perspectives include (1) learning computer science principles, (2) developing CT dispositions, (3) engagement and inclusion in science, (4) taking ownership of science, (5) supporting learning science content, and (6) participating in computational practice as a form of scientific epistemic practice. Our analysis indicates that computational thinking and computational practices are often integrated in science in order to teach something about computing (e.g., Perspective 1), rather than to support learners' scientific work. Only the 29 articles coded for the sixth perspective—that is, in service of epistemic aims in science—demonstrate commitment to students' uses of computational ideas and practices as epistemic tools to participate in the sensemaking work of science. Takeaways: Comparison of Perspectives 5 and 6 illustrates the nuance between computational practices in science that reify something students have already ""figured out,"" rather than those that serve epistemic goals. Perspective 6 encapsulates the deep synergy among (1) the reflexive nature of computing with scientific ideas and (2) computing as a central practice in science and engineering. We contend that a more focused message of computational practices in service of scientific sensemaking goals is necessary if we expect teachers to enact CT and related computational practices in their classrooms. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Science teachers' understanding of the roles of computing practices in science frame how they enact scientific computational practices in their teaching. What this paper adds?: We analysed 54 peer‐reviewed articles regarding teacher learning about the role of computational literacy and computing practices in K‐12 science teaching.We characterized the ways the researchers and teacher participants describe the affordances of integrating computational thinking (CT) and other computational practices in science.We present six primary affordances for integrating computational practices with science that are conveyed to teachers and by teachers, as represented in these studies of teacher learning.

Therefore, schools and teachers should integrate CT into their instructional practices. Particularly, the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects are seen as a meaningful context for embedding CT. Yet, there are only a few professional development programs that address STEM teachers and how to integrate CT. Thus, in our study, we redesigned an in‐service teacher training program. The redesigned program was offered in a blended‐learning format, consisting of alternating digital and face‐to‐face phases. As part of the digital phases, an interactive online self‐learning module on CT was introduced to foster transdisciplinary competencies in the field of STEM to solve complex problems. To identify the perceptions and development of the participants of the training program and the online module on CT a within‐subject design was used with a questionnaire survey, conducted with a pre‐post‐follow‐up design. The first results of the ongoing survey indicate high satisfaction with both the program itself and the online CT module. At the beginning of the program, about two‐thirds of the participating teachers were completely unfamiliar with the term CT, nevertheless, interest in the new topic was high. It was shown the program was able to create initial awareness of the meaning and importance of CT. In addition, teachers who have engaged with CT during the intervention seem to use CT‐related practices more often in the classroom afterward.

Understanding how CT skills can be fostered in learning programming concepts through co-creating digital games is crucial to determine instructional strategies that match the young students' interests and capacities. The empirical study has successfully produced a new checklist that can be used as a tool to describe the learning of CT skills when children co-create digital games. The checklist consists of 10 core CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, generalisation, representation, socialisation, code literacy, automation, coordination, and debugging. Thirty-six 10–12 year-olds from sub-urban primary schools in Borneo participated in creating games in three separate eight-hour sessions. In addition, one pilot session with five participants was conducted. The game co-creation process was recorded to identify and determine how these young, inexperienced, untrained young learners collaborated while using CT skills. Analysis of their narratives while co-creating digital games revealed a pattern of using CT while developing the games. Although none of the groups demonstrated the use of all ten CTs, conclusively, all ten components of the CT were visibly present in their co-created digital games.

Understanding an algorithmic solution to a problem is a very relevant activity to improve end-users' involvement. To this end, adopting a meta-design approach may help to support end-users to appropriate the design skills necessary for contributing to system design, in new and engaging modalities. By acquiring Computational Thinking (CT) skills (e.g., algorithmic thinking, abstraction), end-users will be able to understand and trust algorithms, while at the same time participate in the design and development of systems evolving in accordance with their needs. In this work, we focus on two different ways of improving CT skills: playfulness and collaboration. We introduce a game-based system, TAPASPlay, to foster CT skills and we report the results of an exploratory study with 18 users; our hypothesis is that learning CT through gameplay is effective and we tested it by involving participants in game sessions providing playful experience and collaborative learning.

The exercise is a simple finite element assignment designed for the M.Sc. students in Mechanical and Civil Engineering. It comprises a two‐member frame with a variety of loading that can be solved manually without using any computer programming. Individual data is allocated to each student, and they have been asked to report their results like reaction forces, reaction moments and stresses. Thereafter they have modelled the same frame structure in commercially available finite element method (FEM) software ABAQUS, from which a substantial output file is created for such a simple problem. In the final stage, each student highlights the ABAQUS results that can be compared and commented upon with the results obtained from their manual calculations. Since the assignment is individual, it provides a justifiable connection between computational thinking of an individual mind, with printed outputs of a complicated FEM software. Implementing this assignment in M.Sc. finite element course at Aberdeen University has been very successful. This enabled individual students to relate their computational thinking, with the results of complicated FEM software in engineering. It is concluded that such exercises can stimulate computational thinking in engineering education. Moreover, they can be used in other engineering fields where FEM is applicable, either at the university level or Professional and Career Development courses in engineering.

This contribution presents a cross-sectional study examining the coding practices and computational thinking of fifty-one primary school children using the ScratchJr software; children were organized in two cohorts (Cohort 1: 6–9 years old; Cohort 2: 10–12 years old). Each cohort participated in a six-hour intervention, as part of a four-day summer club. During the intervention children were introduced to ScratchJr and were asked to collaboratively design a digital story about environmental waste management actions, thus adopting a disciplinary perspective to computational thinking. Data analyses examined children's final artifacts, in terms of coding practices and the level of computational thinking demonstrated by each cohort. Furthermore, analysis of selected groups' storyboard interviews was used to shed light on differences between the two cohorts. Results are presented and contrasted across the two age cohorts via a developmental perspective. The findings of this study can be useful in considering the instructional support that is necessary to scaffold the development of primary school children's coding practices and computational thinking.

This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs.

Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books' target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as ""foundational,"" ""on-target,"" or ""advanced."" We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.

Students can improve their CT ability by learning programming languages. Moreover, situated learning enables students to generate knowledge and master problem-solving skills through interaction with situations. This study incorporated Webduino learning and the situated learning strategy into a programming course and analyzed its impact on high school students' CT ability, learning motivation, and course satisfaction. A quasi-experimental research method was adopted, wherein the experimental group was subjected to the situated learning strategy and the control group was subjected to a traditional teaching method. The study results revealed that integrating Webduino programming with situated learning could effectively improve five categories of CT skills; moreover, the activity models of situated learning enhanced the value and expectation dimensions of learning motivation. In addition, satisfaction with the course content and self-identity slightly improved. However, because teachers were required to elaborate on stories to promote learner engagement with life situations, the time available for programming was limited. Thus, no significant difference was observed in teaching satisfaction.

A total of 158 junior high school students and one teacher participated in the study over 5 months. The sample students were divided into four experimental groups in four single or combined programming approaches (i.e., plugged-in, unplugged, unplugged first, and plugged-in first) and one control group without programming. Data sources included the results of four CT tests, as well as interviews with the teacher and surveys with 24 representative participants. The results showed that the four programming approaches can effectively improve students' CT skills and can be retained after two months. Among them, the form of implementing unplugged activities before plugged-in can most effectively improve CT skills, and can better weaken the impact of previous programming experience. Finally, the qualitative analysis results provided insights into the process of programming and CT education. These findings will provide implications for the introduction of CT in junior high school, and help expand students' participation in computing.

However, most studies on the topic have investigated the development of computational thinking through programming activities, which are cognitively demanding. There is a dearth of evidence on how computational thinking augments everyday problem solving when it is decontextualized from programming. Objectives: In this study, we examined how computational thinking, when untangled from the haze of programming, is demonstrated in everyday problem solving, and investigated the features of such solvable problems. Methods: Using a multiple case study approach, we tracked how seven university students used computational thinking to solve the everyday problem of a route planning task as part of an 8‐week‐long Python programming course. Results and Conclusions: Computational thinking practices are latent in everyday problems, and intentionally structuring everyday problems is valuable for discovering the applicability of computational thinking. Decomposition and abstraction are prominent computational thinking components used to simplify everyday problem solving. Implications: It is important to strike a balance between the correctness of algorithms and simplification of the process of everyday problem solving. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking is a problem solving skill.Computational thinking is different from programming.There is dearth of evidence on how computational thinking augments everyday problem solving. What this paper adds: Computational thinking practices are latent in everyday problem solving.Intentional restructuring of problems is required to uncover how computational thinking applies in solving them. Implications for practices: Decomposition and abstraction are critical in solving everyday problems.Computational thinking should be taught explicitly through everyday problems.Finding balance between the correctness of algorithm and simplification of the problem solving process is important.

This paper describes a scoping review of learning tools for integrating CT and mathematics in current empirical studies published from 2015 to 2021. The review showed that most of the studies implemented CT-intensive Math-connected integration. Five major types of CT tools had been identified, i.e., digital tangibles, apps and games, programming languages, formative or summative assessments, and other technological tools. In many instances, the tools also provide functions of assessment of CT skills. The most assessed CT competencies were including algorithms and algorithmic thinking, abstraction, testing and debugging, loops, and sequences. Geometry and Measurement was the most assessed mathematics topic. Our scoping review is beneficial in the investigation of the literature on CT and mathematics education, as well as guides those who are interested in developing curriculum, programs, or assessments that involve the integration of CT and mathematics.

This systematic review evaluated existing studies in improving K-12 students' computational thinking and STEM attitudes. Research articles published between 2010 and 2019 were collated from major databases according to six criteria, and 17 studies were eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of educational robots in terms of standardized mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) of test scores as outcome measures. The overall effect size was medium (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.69). Subgroup analysis found that some groups to have better effectiveness. Specifically, the effect of STEM attitudes (SMD = 0.01) was smaller than computational thinking (SMD = 0.48). Educational robots had more significant effect on boys (MD = 0.39) than girls (MD = 0.27). The effect in primary school (SMD = 0.27) was higher than in middle school (SMD = 0.04), and the effect was great on short-term instruction with educational robots (SMD = 0.35). Based on these results, the study makes some recommendations for educators about strengthening the influence of educational robots on STEM attitudes, improving the persistence of their learning effects, and further exploring their application models.

Prior research has shown numerous interdisciplinary benefits related to CT, however, these influential factors have often been investigated with relatively few variables. This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students' development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills. Results were interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using collaborative robotics in an educational setting.

Many visual programming environments (VPEs) and physical robot courses have been integrated into computational thinking learning in the elementary education stage. This study explores the relationship between the programming learning environment (including VPE, physical robots, and no experience) and the computational thinking ability of higher-grade elementary school students of different genders. The results show that learning through VPE or physical robots can help students improve their computational thinking ability and that students learn better via physical robots. In addition, among the four dimensions of computational thinking ability, most students are weak in algorithm design. In terms of gender, no differences exist in computational thinking ability. Further analysis reveals that female students have better decomposition performance in VPE learning, while male students have better algorithm design performance.

Specifically, whether the proposed instructional design combining computational perspectives and an embodied approach in mathematics learning improves (a) mathematics learning, (b) problem-solving skills in programing, and (c) computational thinking. The study used a quantitative quasi-experimental design with 115 second- to fourth-grade students. Findings suggested that embodied activities combined with the practice of taking computational perspectives in solving mathematics problems led to improved knowledge in mathematics, programing concepts, and computational thinking among young learners. This paper also discusses how to make the computational thinking process more concrete and relevant within the context of mathematics to promote computational thinking skills.

On the other hand, educational challenges promote the search for new instructional tools and approaches. Consequently, learning shall be extended by superimposing science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) approach in the instructional practices. The aim of this paper is to show how STEAM approach can develop the computational thinking among high school learners. The main skills of computational thinking included: algorithmic thinking, abstraction, decomposition, and generalization. The sample of this study involved 32 high school students in a private school in Amman. The experimental group studied geography skills in a STEAM approach that included the use of online resources such as LightBot maze and the Ordnance Survey maps (OS) website. The control group studied the same content but through conventional method. Findings showed a significant development in the computational thinking especially in algorithmic thinking and abstraction. Thus a STEAM approach learning environment is one of the effective methods of teaching that improved computational thinking.

Data from 70 students aged 11–12 were analysed using factorial multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance. Our findings revealed that while effective in fostering conceptual knowledge of CT (such as sequence, loop, and conditional), the conventional technology‐enhanced learning approach falls short when it comes to promoting CT skills (such as pattern recognition and debugging). The game approach, however, could simultaneously promote CT skills and conceptual knowledge, leading to improvement in the overall knowledge of CT. Additional analysis showed that learners with different prior knowledge and learning attitudes made a higher improvement using the adaptive game in terms of skills, conceptual knowledge, and overall knowledge of CT, especially for medium and lower prior knowledge learners that did not have a very high prior learning attitude. Consequently, to promote CT in primary school students, educators can employ computer game approaches that not only can foster both skills and conceptual knowledge of CT but also more effectively assist students with lower prior learning attitudes and knowledge.

However, the associations between them are still not fully understood despite their recognition as essential competencies for the digital age. This study looks to bridge this gap by examining the association between CT and two types of creativity, i.e., Creative Thinking and Computational Creativity. The research was conducted among 124 middle school students from Spain, who were divided into control and experimental groups; the intervention included an explicit encouragement to be as creative as possible (i.e., to submit multiple correct solutions) in a given learning task. Data were analyzed from a standardized creativity test (Torrance's TTCT) and cross-referenced with log files that documented the students' activities in the Kodetu game-based learning environment. Our research findings indicate some interesting associations between CT and Creativity. First, we found that creativity contributes to CT. Second, we found that CT is transferable across different domains. Finally, we found that Computational Creativity can develop and improve over time.

However, most prior literature defines computational thinking as thinking outcomes rather than thinking processes. Based on Selby and Woodland's framework, this study developed and validated the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) to assess all students' thought processes of computational thinking for both general and specific problem-solving contexts in five dimensions: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. A survey including 25 candidate items for CTS as well as demographic variables was administered to 388 junior high school students in Taiwan. An explorative factor analysis using the principal axis method with the oblimin rotation was used to validate the scale. Finally, 19 items were extracted successfully under the designed five dimensions, with a total explained variance of 64.03% and an overall reliability of 0.91. Results of the demographic comparisons showed that boys had a greater disposition than girls in decomposition thinking when solving problems using computer programming. In addition, programming learning experience, especially self-directed learning and after-school learning, had significant positive effects on all dimensions of CTS. Several future studies are suggested using this tool.

Through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling we validated the scale with data from 245 elementary teachers from eight U.S. school districts who participated in computing teacher development and taught coding to elementary students over one school year. Teachers' self-efficacy for coding and computational thinking increased significantly as they taught coding, while their teaching efficacy for computing increased the most. The resulting 33-item TBaCCT provides a validated scale that can be used to measure elementary teacher beliefs about computing education as they engage in teacher professional development.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using programming to enhance K‐12 students' CT skills and explore the influence of various programming instructional design factors on the acquisition of CT skills. This study presents a quantitative meta‐analysis. A systematic search of randomized controlled studies on the influence of programming on CT skills. A total of 86 empirical studies with 114 effect sizes met the study selection criterion. The results showed that programming improved K‐12 students' CT skills in general (Hedges' g = 0.601, 95% CI [0.505, 0.697], p < 0.001). No publication bias was detected. Besides, we found that the interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within 1 week to 1 month, the class size of less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and CT assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills. Based on these findings, we suggest that programming instructional design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills. This will be of great significance to programming teaching and CT education in K‐12. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in K‐12 has become a key issue.One of the latest trends in the education field is computer programming in K‐12 classrooms to cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design may affect the influence of programming education on students' CT skills. However, there is a lack of overall quantitative synthesis of existing empirical research. What this paper adds: A meta‐analysis of 86 studies was conducted to provide systematic evidence that programming education is effective to promote K‐12 students' CT skills.Programming teaching design factors such as subjects, intervention duration, sample size, programming instruments and assessment types can affect CT skills in programming activities.Programming activity forms cannot affect CT skills in programming activities. Implications for practice and/or policy: The implementation of programming education in K‐12 schooling can effectively cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills.The interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within one week to one month, control of class size to less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills.

Participation observations and interviews were conducted to explained students' novice player experiences, learned CT after their first-time exposures to CO, and usability feedback to the board game. The major findings of this study were two- fold. First, students were motivated and engaged, using board games to learn computational thinking. The winning strategies that students generated throughout the game promoted higher-order computational thinking. Second, students comprehended and interpreted the conceptual elements of computational thinking well after playing the game, having only a fraction of misconceptions. Overall, novice young players' experience were positive, and they provided usability feedback and direction to improving CO.

A set of UPTA was created and used in a primary school in southern China. A total of 48 students aged 6–8 were assigned to two classes, with the same instructor and learning materials, but only the treatment group was provided with the UPTA. Both groups were tested on computational thinking ability, children's concrete operation status, degree of ego-centricity, and in-classroom interaction. Results indicated that the children aged 6–8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children's computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry.

A mixed-methods approach was employed in a study involving 60 participants; half were given CT instruction and half were instructed traditionally. Quantitative data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and path analysis, while MAXQDA software was employed for qualitative interview data. The study found a positive correlation between CT instruction and academic self-efficacy with increased academic resilience, particularly in the experimental group, and identified key factors contributing to resilience. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of computational thinking (CT) and academic self-efficacy in enhancing academic performance, offering a new understanding of how these elements can be integrated into education to boost student resilience. It establishes a direct empirical link between CT instruction and increased academic self-efficacy, underscoring the value of specific teaching methodologies in fostering resilience. The findings are significant for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders in developing strategies to enhance students' academic and personal success, thereby promoting their overall well-being. Recognizing the importance of CT and self-efficacy paves the way for customized educational programs that effectively support and empower students to thrive.

To address this research gap, this study analyses the participants' thinking processes in solving programming-based mathematical problems from a flexibility perspective, focusing on the interplay between computational and mathematical thinking, that is, how CT and MT work together to influence and determine the problem-solver's choice of solution strategy. Using data collected from a large design-based study, we summarise two types of flexibility and six subtypes of flexibility demonstrated by participants in the programming-based mathematical problem-solving process using thematic analysis. These different types of flexibility provide researchers and mathematics educators with new theoretical perspectives to examine the interplay of CT and MT. Findings will also contribute toward student learning characteristics in programming-based mathematical problem-solving to sketch the big picture of how CT and MT emerge in complementary or mismatching ways.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether peer code review (PCR) could affect CT, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction in a blended learning environment. To achieve this, we carried out a randomized control trial study involving 84 first‐year undergraduates (second semester) from different majors. There was no difference in CT before this experiment and after the experiment, general CT, specific CT, learning engagement, and satisfaction were measured. An independent sample t test showed that students learning with code peer review showed better performance on computational concepts, computational perspectives, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction (p <.001). Bayesian t test further showed substantial or strong evidence for the improvement of computational concepts, learning engagement, learning satisfaction, and computational perspectives. Moreover, the absolute values of Cohen's effect sizes of computational concept, computational perspectives, emotional engagement, behavior engagement, learning engagement, learning satisfaction were all above 0.4, which is viewed as educationally meaningful. Although there was no difference in the general CT, we still saw evidence of improvement over the course of the experiment. Overall, our findings suggest instructors to use PCR reasonably to further improve CT, learning engagement, and satisfaction in programming courses.

The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students' English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students' foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach.

In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)-an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies. We use this scheme to dynamically scaffold learners when they are deficient in performing their tasks, or they demonstrate suboptimal use of strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a classroom study where one group of 6th grade students received scaffolding and the other did not. We found that students who received scaffolding built more accurate models, used modeling strategies effectively, adopted more useful modeling behaviors, showed a better understanding of important science and CT concepts, and transferred their modeling skills better to new scenarios.

The concept of computational thinking education is to allow students to find solutions to problems in different fields by understanding the problems and analyzing solution steps. In this study, we integrate the concept of computational thinking education into a course on plot image-based virtual reality (VR). It combined shooting of the actual field, instructions on the movie required to be shot, and VR in order to enable students to get immersed in thinking about problems and understanding the actual field through plot image-based VR, further plan to learn the essence of problems, and develop possible solutions. Through experimental results of experimental and control groups, we found that plot image-based VR can effectively improve students' interests in learning and computational thinking.

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill which can motivate students' English language learning. Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners' motivation and performance. The method of ""present, practice, and produce"" was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students' language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning.

The participants were 360 students studying in various departments at different universities in Turkey for computer programming. The scale consists of 33 items under conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation subscale. While there was no significant difference between the students' conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more. It is thought that this scale, which is structured for different applications (e.g., web, game, robot) and learning environments (e.g., text, block) within the framework of its programming capabilities (conceptual, semantic, strategic knowledge), will contribute significantly to the evaluation of computational thinking as programming oriented.

However, whether students' learning attitude towards STEM is related to their CT skills remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to address this knowledge gap. In Study 1, we validated a newly developed STEM learning attitude scale among a sample of Chinese primary school students (N = 489). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the scale which consisted of three factors (mathematics, science and information technology) could sufficiently measure primary school students' STEM learning attitude in the current sample. In Study 2, we explored the association between students' STEM learning attitude and their CT skills. Evidence revealed that learning attitude towards STEM significantly predicted CT skills. We also found that girls had a more positive learning attitude towards STEM than boys, and the fourth grade might be the key period for the development of CT skills. Implications for promoting primary school students' STEM learning and CT skills were also discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic: Computational thinking (CT) plays a more and more important role in K‐12 education.STEM has become a natural field for integrating CT into classroom.Students' learning attitude determines their performance and achievements.CT is influenced by personal and situational factors. What this paper adds: Reliability and validity of the STEM learning attitude scale are psychometrically good.Students' STEM learning attitude can positively predict their CT skills.Girls may have more potential for the cultivation of CT in STEM education.The fourth grade may be the key period for the development of CT skills. Implications for practice and/or policy: Promoting CT skills in STEM education by improving students' learning attitude.Adopting teaching methods according to students' psychological and cognitive characteristics.Grasping the key stage of fourth grade to develop students' CT skills.Encouraging and protecting girls' interests and ideas in STEM education.

There are misconceptions about CT which confounds CT skills with programming skills. However, CT skills and programming skills are not the same. CT is a broader skillset of cognitive thinking that is integral to complex problem solving. Teaching and assessing CT should not only focus on computer programming. In this project, a new design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students' CT. This approach not only included programming skills, but also integrated CT practices with authentic real-life contexts. Corresponding to recent conceptions of CT, we also assessed CT in a more comprehensive manner. A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students' self-perceived CT skills using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In the treatment group, twenty-three fourth graders engaged in three curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using LabPlus electronic kits and Scratch programming software. The control group took a traditional computer science class. Results revealed that students' self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent in the treatment group compared to the control group. In addition, we observed and interviewed three student cases in the treatment group to understand the potential learning effects of our new DBL approach. This study contributes to research in CT instruction, its application in STEM education in particular, and how it can be used in elementary level education in general.

The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education.

Computational thinking has attracted much interest and debatably ranks in importance with the time-honoured literacy skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, learning interventions in this subject have modelled computational thinking differently. We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming.

Our results suggested that the challenges experienced by students were compounded by both having to learn the CT-based environment as well as to apply mathematical concepts and problem solving in that environment. Possible explanations for the observed challenges stemming from differences between CT and mathematical thinking are discussed in detail, along with suggestions towards improving the effectiveness of integrating CT into mathematics learning.

In this article, we proposed a CT-integration model called TPC2T. In this model, we suggested considering CT as a second subject and using an appropriate technological pedagogical approach to make students' learning of two subjects meaningful and engaging. We implemented this model in a CT-integrated lesson in two sections of a high-school Spanish course. Students worked in small groups and coded three small and one comprehensive digital Spanish-culture stories in Scratch. Results showed that students taking the CT-integrated lesson had the same degree of improvement in their Spanish culture knowledge as their peers who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. Besides, students taking the CT-integrated lesson had a significant improvement in their CT knowledge. At the same time, their CT self-efficacy outperformed those who did not take the CT-integrated lesson.

We analyzed reflections of 80 in-service teachers on TPD through the SPOC (1,091 statements) and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 of them one year after completing the course and teaching ECR in the classroom (328 statements). The most prominent strategies immediately after the TPD were constructing learning experiences, tinkering & debugging, and interdisciplinary learning, while one year later, experiential learning and collaborative learning were more common. Regarding the degree of teacher centrality, a year after teaching ECR curriculum the teachers had a significantly higher percentage of statements reflecting their role as a guide-on-the-side and as a partner of students in the learning process. Regarding the contribution of the SPOC for TPD, teacher statements revealed significantly more benefits than challenges in both points of time.

Current students' generation is looking for engaging, motivating learning activities with immediate results and feedback. The paper presents the design process of the strategy for CT abilities development. The proposed strategy has been implemented in practice identify its suitability for successful CT development within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. The strategy is accompanied by teaching materials for computational making activities with Arduino. The proposed strategy contributes to Engineering education as an essential part of STEAM and usually not included in the basic and secondary school curriculum as a separate subject. Pre- and postsurvey were conducted with basic school students to identify the effect of the strategy implementation on the development of CT abilities. The findings of this study showed a statistically significant increase in CT literacy in 14 abilities from seven dimensions: computing artifact, decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, communication and collaboration, computing and society, and evaluation. The implications of this study include the practical usage of the strategy in plan class activities for STEAM subjects in basic school to develop particular CT abilities.

We studied the relationship between these two constructs while focusing on learners' personal characteristics. Two types of creativity were examined: creative thinking and computational creativity. The research was conducted among 174 middle school students from Spain. Data collected using a standardized creativity test (Torrance's TTCT) were triangulated with data drawn from students' log files that documented their activity in a game-based learning environment for CT (Kodetu). We found some interesting associations between CT and the two constructs of creativity. These associations shed light on positive associations between each of the two creativity constructs and CT acquisition, as well as between the two creativity constructs themselves. Additionally, we highlight differences between boys and girls, as girls were found to be more creative on both creativity measures. Other differences associated with school affiliation, prior coding knowledge, and technology affinity are also discussed.

Six of twelve groups created a project using the Arduino IDE platform and the other six created one using the C++ programming language. Accordingly, a significant difference, which is in favour of the post-test, was found in the scores of pre-tests and post-tests of Arduino IDE groups in the scale factors; creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking and the total score of the scale. No significant difference was found in cooperativity and problem solving factors.

The team designed a set of items and explored a subset of those through two qualitative pilots. Then, in order to provide validity evidence based on the test content, a team of 11 subject-matter experts coded the initial pool of items using two different systems of categories based on CT components and contents. Next, the items were piloted on a sample of 289 participants, 137 experts in CT, and 152 novices. After a series of confirmatory factor analyses, a unidimensional model that represents algorithmic thinking was adopted. Further analyzing the psychometric quality of the 27 items, 20 of them with excellent reliability indices were selected for the test. Thus, this study provides a tool to evaluate adults' CT: the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA), which was developed according to psychometric standards.

Relatively few studies have examined programming for CT in informal online communities, especially for large scale quantitative research. With the repurposing and appropriation of code becoming standard practice for youth programmers in new and networked communities, this study proposes a model to investigate and explain how such remixing practices influence CT in learners. In particular, we use social cognitive theory to transform log data from more than 100,000 students and 200,000 programs in the Scratch online community into cognitive, environmental and behavioral factors. Then path modeling was used to show how the community environment can affect learners' remixing and further impact CT skills. The results demonstrate the intertwined relationships among the factors, generally showing that remixing can lead to CT improvement, but that over exposure to the community and excessive remixing can actually hinder CT development.

Students depend on current research to understand the definition, function, and culture of CT and to consider how it can improve their analytical and critical skills. A contextualized definition of the CT method is proposed as a cognitive process executed by humans to solve problems using computational concepts. This method improves CT in terms of decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design, abstraction, data representation, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and generalization of patterns, simulation and evaluation. The research carried out is an experimental design with a pretest and a posttest, with a control group and an experimental group to which the intervention was applied, both with 18 students. This article describes a study developing and incorporating CT modules and assessing their effect on the comprehension of CT principles by preservation teachers as well as their computing attitude. The results show that the implementation of analytical thought in education courses will successfully affect the comprehension of CT principles by preservice students.

However, it is hard to attain in online game‐based environments as the drive to progress in the game may influence the ability to achieve the learning goals. This study aimed to examine the associations between micro‐persistence, that is, the tendency to complete an individual task successfully, and task difficulty while acquiring computational thinking (CT). We further explored whether contextual or personal attributes better explain micro‐persistence. We analysed data of 111 school students who used the CodeMonkey platform. We took a learning analytics approach for analysing the platform's log files. We found that micro‐persistence is associated with task difficulty and that students who demonstrated an aptitude to learn new material are motivated to achieve the best solution. We also found that contextual variables better‐explained micro‐persistence than personal attributes. Encouraging micro‐persistence can improve CT acquisition and the learning processes involved. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Persistence is a substantial quality for learning.In online multi‐challenge environments, it is difficult to maintain persistence because of the urge to advance in the game itself.Persistence has been mostly studied with regarding the learning process as a whole. What this paper adds: Examination of micro‐persistence, that is, persistence at the task level.Students who demonstrate micro‐persistence and aptitude to learn new material are motivated to achieve the highest score.Contextual variables better explain micro‐persistence than personal attributes. Implications of study findings for practitioners: Micro‐persistence may lead to better and deeper learning.Instructional designers who want to maintain micro‐persistence should monitor the difficulty of individual learning tasks.Educators should motivate learners to complete learning tasks and not rely solely on intrinsic motivation.

However, problem-solving with a computer involves much more than just learning programming language syntax. The theory and practice are interrelated in fascinating ways. Whether one thinks that the purpose of college or higher education is to prepare students for an occupation or to develop foundational knowledge with lifetime benefits (or both), computer science (CS) has become a fundamental part of 21st-century life. Even students studying in areas other than CS are likely to have significant encounters with computational thinking (CT) later on in life. Motivation and Objectives: Colleges and universities offer the opportunity for students to take as many courses as they desire in coding, programming, and CS taught by faculty members from that discipline area. However, this approach alone is deemed insufficient for computer-based problem-solving and computer programming. Effective programming teaching pedagogy also requires organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a programming science curriculum (CS). In particular, we need strategies that help us structure multiple paradigm-based teaching curricula into manageable modules. This study aims to develop a framework for programming pedagogy. Research Methodology and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted for identifying, evaluating, and interpreting relevant research to explore programming paradigms that could be incorporated for novice programmers, possible implementation strategies, and instructional methods for teaching text-based programming, CT concepts, and practices. Results and Findings: This paper's focus was on the pedagogical phenomenon of teaching programming considering the evolving paradigms, implementation strategies, and instructional methods and techniques through the lens of CT. Hence, a framework to design a learning path for pedagogical approaches that consist of CT concepts and practices within text-based programming were proposed. The proposed framework is based on the assumption that ""any ongoing research on computing pedagogy requires a review of what CT is, how it impacts on teaching and learning and its role within the pedagogy advocated."" The programming pedagogy framework consists of four fundamental components: programming paradigm, implementation strategy, instructional methods, and instructional techniques.

First, we investigated the feasibility of integrating CT training into the engineering courses through guiding students to perform a topicspecific design task. Second, we compared the influences of the MEA-based approach and conventional lecture-based approach on students' learning effect with respect to course objectives and CT skills. Results show the CT-integrated teaching did not at least weaken the teaching effect of the engineering course, and the MEA-based approach seems to be more conducive to strengthening students' skills of identifying and solving problems, as well as team cooperation. Results also show the learning effect of the MEA group has apparent advantages for enhancing CT skills. These findings suggest that using MEA in engineering courses is beneficial to promote students' CT skills in terms of simplification, embedding, transformation, and simulation.

The YEW curriculum included basic electronics, block-based programming and robotics through Scratch and Arduino, and student projects on building robotics systems. This experimental study aimed to investigate the cognitive and affective consequences of YEW on the development of middle and high school students' computational thinking (CT) competences. The research methodology was based on a one-group pretest-posttest model within a quasi-experimental design. Participants were 17 students from grades 5-6 and 15 students from grades 9-10 in a southwestern city of Turkey. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the YEW application form, a scale for CT, a satisfaction questionnaire, and student diaries. The results showed a significant increase on algorithmic and critical thinking factors of CT whereas no significant changes in creativity, cooperation, and problem-solving factors of CT. Students reported affective gains including high satisfaction and enjoyment of YEW activities, increased interest, and career planning in programming and robotics fields, and improved self-confidence in robotics project development. In conclusion, the study suggests that teaching programming can be an effective way to foster CT to some extent but not an adequate or complete solution. Educators need to seek more suitable teaching methods for a more comprehensive learning of CT that can be transferable to noncomputing contexts.

One goal of this implementation is to teach computational thinking (CT), which is potentially applicable in various computational problem-solving situations. However, the educational objective of CT in primary schools is somewhat unclear: curricula in various countries define learning objectives for topics, such as computer science, computing, programming or digital literacy but not for CT specifically. Additionally, there has been confusion in concretely and comprehensively defining and operationalising what to teach, learn and assess about CT in primary education even with popular programming akin to Scratch. In response to the growing demands of CT, by conducting a literature review on studies utilising Scratch in K-9, this study investigates what kind of CT has been assessed in Scratch at the primary education level. As a theoretical background for the review, we define a tangible educational objective for introducing CT comprehensively in primary education and concretise the fundamental skills and areas of understanding involved in CT as its ""core educational principles"". The results of the review summarise Scratch programming contents that students can manipulate and activities in which they can engage that foster CT. Moreover, methods for formatively assessing CT via students' Scratch projects and programming processes are explored. The results underpin that the summarised ""CT-fostering"" programming contents and activities in Scratch are vast and multidimensional. The next steps for this study are to refine pedagogically meaningful ways to assess CT in students' Scratch projects and programming processes.

Many studies have shown that computational thinking can be improved by programming, for example, using Scratch, App Inventor, and Python. However, different programming tools have different forms of programming that affect the development of learners' computational thinking. This study aimed to test the effects of different programming tools with the same teaching content on learners' computational thinking and computer learning attitude in real classroom teaching. Ninety‐nine participants took part in an eight‐week teaching intervention in the Visual Basic (text‐based) and Pencil Code (block‐based) programming environments. T tests showed that students learning in a mixed text‐based and block‐based Pencil Code programming environment not only had significantly improved computational thinking but also became more self‐confident and enjoyed learning programming. Furthermore, our interviews after the eight‐week teaching intervention found that students showed more communication and interaction behaviors learning with Pencil Code.

Studies show that some children can develop computational thinking skills and practices with programming activities when learning with the tools through a well-design curriculum in elementary education (or primary education). However, existing studies may not completely address whether programming skills and computational thinking can be connected to the development of other generic skills, which are considered important to the learning and cognitive development of children. This study investigates the impact of programming on three learning competencies (creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving) known as twenty-first century skills. The conceptual mapping between programming, computational thinking and the three learning competencies is presented. In a one-year intervention in a primary school, students were taught how to build interactive games through programming, and thus explored some basic computational thinking concepts in class. Our results show that children perceived a significant impact of programming on their learning competencies. Yet, the transferability of twenty-first century skills developed through computational thinking and programming may require a further study. Our study provides insights from children as primary respondents to help direct future research in the field of programming and computational thinking education and its potential impact on twenty-first century skills.

Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers' views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.

Nonetheless, there are few studies which attempt to analyse their influence at the stage of Primary Education. We present the results of a quasi-experimental piece of research with sixth-grade students which studies the influence of Scratch both on the acquisition of mathematical concepts, and on the development of computational thinking. The experiment consisted of two different phases, a programming phase linked to the instruction in Scratch and focused on the acquisition of basic concepts of computational thinking (sequences, iterations, conditionals, and events-handling), and a mathematical phase completely oriented towards the resolution of mathematical tasks. In particular, the mathematical phase focused on word problems whose resolution involves the use of the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor. In order to evaluate the aims of the study, results from tests before and after instruction, both in computational thinking and in the mathematical standards, were compared. The results seem to indicate that Scratch can be used to develop both students' mathematical ideas and computational thinking.

Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics. We compare these elements of mathematical thinking to related elements of CT to identify synergies and differences between CT and mathematical thinking. We argue that these synergies and differences have implications for the development of integrated instruction designed to bring CS to all.

Data sources included pre–post content assessments of computational concepts related to programming in addition to computational artifacts and interviews with a purposeful sample of 12 participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify gains in pre- and post-learning of computational thinking concepts and examine potential gender differences. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that students made significant gains in their learning of computational thinking concepts and that gains persisted over time. Results also revealed differences in learning of computational thinking concepts among boys and girls both at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, results from student interviews provided insights into the development of computational thinking practices and perspectives over time.

Thus, the change in programming performance, computational identity, computational thinking perspective, programming empowerment, and programming anxiety according to various variables was examined. The performances of different algorithms were compared in estimating the low and high programming performance of these variables. The research involved 763 students who were between the ages of 12 and 24 and had received programming education. Different scales were used to collect the opinions of students who received programming education. Descriptive analyses, one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and machine learning algorithms were used in the analysis of the data set. Analyzes were made in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Knime software. Decision trees, k‐nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, Naive Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression were used in the study. Students' programming performance, computational identity, computational thinking perspective, and programming empowerment mean scores differ in terms of gender and educational level variables. Research variables do not differ statistically in terms of academic success level variables. According to the programming performance level, students' computational identity, computational thinking perspective, and programming empowerment scores differ. No significant difference was found between programming anxiety scores. Decision trees of the algorithm with the highest accuracy result according to low and high programming performance conditions are [(0.966), (0.966)], respectively. The fact that these obtained scores are above 90% can be interpreted as sufficient estimation performance.

In this paper, we take a place-based approach to examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10–16) in a rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based, mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.

Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game's levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking—the thought process of solving problems through abstraction—which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow's citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkey™). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040). Overall, we find that persistence is positively associated with difficulty and that the most determined learners were highly persistent across topics in achieving the best solution.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers’ coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants’ reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants’ written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers’ reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.

We studied the associations between these two constructs among middle school students (N = 57), considering two types of creativity: a general creative thinking, and a specific computational creativity. We did so using learning analytics, specifically, by operationalizing a log-based assessment of computational creativity. We find some evidence for an association between Computational Creativity and Computational Thinking: Demonstrating originality in an early stage of the game is associated with succeeding in this stage relatively easily, however negatively associated with progressing farther in the game. We also find that Computational Creativity is better explained by a state- rather than a trait-model. No associations were found between Creative Thinking and Computational Thinking. Furthermore, we find some striking associations between the two measures of creativity.

It involves identifying and understanding a problem, articulating an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, implementing that solution in such a way that the solution solves the problem, and evaluating the solution based on some set of criteria. CAT is an important scaffolded on-ramp as students develop more advanced computational thinking capabilities and apply computational thinking to solve problems that are more constrained and require greater expertise. Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) is both a longitudinal between-subjects research project and a free enrichment program supporting and guiding African-American middle school girls over three years as they iteratively design a set of complex games for social change. This article explores Scholars' reflections about the difficulties they faced while using CAT capabilities as they engaged in collaborative game design for social change over those three years. We particularly focus on how these difficulties changed over the course of three years as well as new difficulties that emerged from year to year as Scholars become more expert game designers and computational algorithmic thinkers.

Although the conceive‐design‐implement‐operate (CDIO) approach and computational thinking (CT) are hot topics in recent decades, there are still two deficiencies: the CDIO approach and CT are discussed separately and a general framework of coping with complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation is missing. In this paper, a collaborative strategy based on the CDIO and CT is proposed for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation with a general framework, in which the CDIO is about ""how to do,"" CT is about ""how to think,"" and the project means ""what to do."" As an illustration, the problem of solving the period of mathematical pendulum is discussed in detail. The most challenging task involved in the problem is to compute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI‐1). In the philosophy of STEM education, all problems have more than one solution. For computing the CEI‐1, four methods are discussed with a top‐down strategy, which includes the infinite series method, arithmetic‐geometric mean method, Gauss–Chebyshev method, and Gauss‐Legendre method. The algorithms involved can be utilized for R & D projects of interest and be reused according to the requirements encountered. The general framework for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation is worth recommending to college students and instructors.

However, most existing games have focused on the theoretical knowledge of computational thinking, ignoring the development of computational thinking skills. Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students' computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students' computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills. Moreover, students using the adaptive educational computer game showed a significantly higher level of interest, satisfaction, flow state, and technology acceptance in learning computational thinking. Implications of the findings are also discussed.

In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct field of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other fields. Many recent efforts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these efforts may help identify specific curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not sufficiently capture the specificity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led efforts. In this special issue, we offer a counterproposal to one-size-fits-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent definitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning. Reflecting on these examples can help researchers and educators alike cultivate an awareness of the ways in which learners and educators leverage computing to think, create, and participate across a variety of spaces.

Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects' code analysis.

Twelve third graders (six males and six females) voluntarily participated in an experiment-based computer class conducted at a public elementary school in Taiwan. This study adopted a case study methodology to investigate research questions in one specific case (8-week CT educational training). A one-group quasi-experimental pretest and posttest design with the support of qualitative observation was used to examine four research topics: CT competence progress, programming behaviors in a CT framework, factors influencing CT competence, and learning responses to CT training. The quantitative results indicated that students immersing in weekly programming projects significantly improved in terms of their CT competence, which was mostly retained 1 month after completion of the class. The programming behaviors indicated that students' CT concepts (sequence, event, and parallelism) and practice (testing and debugging as well as reusing and remixing) significantly improved. Moreover, parents' active involvement in take-home assignments influenced students' long-term CT competence retention. The qualitative results indicated that students enjoyed using tablet computers to learn ScratchJr programming and demonstrated various leaning behaviors in a three-stage instructional design model.

In this study, an equation puzzle game was developed by combining pattern recognition with algebraic reasoning, and scaffolding was designed to support learners' learning. Sixty participants were enrolled in this study, divided into a control group and an experimental group to compare the results and differences in game achievement, flow, anxiety, and motivation of participants with and without algebraic reasoning scaffolding. The results of the study showed that the participants in both groups had positive flow and motivation during the game, did not feel over-anxious, and there was no significant difference in the game achievement of the two groups. In addition, the game with the scaffolding may have the potential to make a positive correlation between game achievement and psychological status. The results of this study indicated that the game did not cause too much anxiety to the participants. The scaffolding-based design achieves the intended effect on the participants' assistance and facilitates the participants' engagement in pattern recognition problem solving. And as learners became more focused and engaged, they could also perform better in the game. This game mechanism can be used as a reference for designing pattern recognition games.

This study proposes the combination of modeling and simulation practices along with disciplinary learning as a way to synergistically integrate and take advantage of computational thinking in engineering education. This paper first proposes a framework that identifies different audiences of computing and related computational thinking practices at the intersection of computer science and engineering. Then, based on a survey with 37 experts from industry and academia, this paper also suggests a series of modeling and simulation practices, methods, and tools for such audiences. Finally, this paper also reports experts' identified challenges and opportunities for integrating modeling and simulation practices at the undergraduate level. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side. • A characterization of End-User Development applied in work scenarios is proposed. • The crossover between End-User Development and Computational Thinking is analyzed. • The definition of the EUDability construct is presented.

In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of ""design friendliness"" and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a ""designer friendly"" working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

In this article, we explore the impact of the global pandemic on a massive open online course, Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking, with a particular focus on the topics learners chose for their final projects. The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the ""big ideas"" of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole.

There is limited research on how to apply Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO) engineering design in STEM courses and how it affects students' creativity. This study strategically integrated computational thinking (CT), STEM, and CDIO engineering design, based on Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory, into a course. This study has adopted a framework to design creative learning materials and examined how this framework impacts students' creativity. This study used a pretest–posttest nonequivalent-groups design. The study investigated a STEM course which had 40 participants (n = 40, male = 11, female = 29) for 12 weeks. 6 weeks were spent using traditional teaching and 6 weeks integrating a CDIO framework into computational thinking. All the students in the course were college students with teacher college backgrounds. To examine the impact of our course, we used a questionnaire to examine the students' creativity before and after the STEM course was applied. Our results show that our course had a significantly impact on our students' creativity, particularly in the case of the male students. This finding is consistent with the findings of other research studies. This study also offers some suggestions for teachers who wish to improve their learning materials.

Computational thinking is defined in the context of twenty-first century skills and describes processes involved in (re)formulating a problem in a way that a computer can process it. Programming robots offers specific affordances as it can be used to develop programs following a Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) cycle. The literature provides evidence that programming robots has the potential to enhance algorithmic thinking as a component of computational thinking. Specifically there are indications that pupils who use SRA-programming learn algorithmic skills better and achieve a higher level of self-efficacy in an open, scaffold learning environment than through direct instruction. In order to determine the influence of the instruction variant used, an experimental research design was made in which pupils solved algorithm-based mathematical problems (grid diagrams) in a preliminary measurement and their self-efficacy determined via a questionnaire. As an intervention, pupils learn to solve programming issues in pairs using ""Lego NXT"" robots and ""Mindstorms"" software in two instruction variants. The post-measurement consists of a Lego challenge, solving mathematical problems (grid diagrams), and a repeated self-efficacy questionnaire. This research shows an increase of our measures on algorithmic thinking dependent on the amount of SRA usage (though not significant). Programming using the SRA-cycle can be considered as the cause of the measured effect. The instruction variant used during the robotic intervention seems to play only a marginal role.

To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

The results suggest that: (a) students reach eventually the same level of CT skills development independent of their age and gender, (b) CT skills in most cases need time to fully develop (students’ scores improve significantly towards the end of the activity), (c) age and gender relevant differences appear when analysing students’ score in the various specific dimensions of the CT skills model, (d) the modality of the skill assessment instrument may have an impact on students’ performance, (e) girls appear in many situations to need more training time to reach the same skill level compared to boys.

The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task’s applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks’ difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students’ interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment.

Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies, 4(3), 1181–1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.

To better improve university students' CT competence, collaborative programming is regarded as an effective learning approach. However, how novice programmers develop CT competence through collaborative problem solving remains unclear. This study adopted an innovative approach, quantitative ethnography, to analyze the collaborative programming activities of a high‐performing and a low‐performing team. Both the discourse analysis and epistemic network models revealed that across concepts, practices, and identity, the high‐performing team exhibited CT that was systematic, whereas the CT of the low‐performing team was characterized by tinkering or guess‐and‐check approaches. However, the low‐performing group's CT development trajectory ultimately converged towards the high‐performing group's. This study thus improves understanding of how novices learn CT, and it illustrates a useful method for modeling CT based in authentic problem‐solving contexts. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computational thinking competence includes computational concepts, computational practices, and computational perspectives.Collaborative programming has the potential to foster computational thinking competence development.What this paper adds: The low‐performing student group adopted a bottom‐up perspective at the beginning but transformed to a top‐down approach by the end.The low‐performing group's computational thinking development trajectory had convergent evolution towards the high‐performing group's trajectory.Implications for practice and/or policy: Computational thinking competence can be developed in collaborative contexts even when students begin with a bottom‐up approach.Computational thinking should go beyond the cognitive development of computational concepts to connect computational practice and computational identity.Quantitative ethnography approach has potential to model computational thinking competence in collaborative programming context.

Indeed, syntax errors—which form one of two broad categories of errors in programming, the other one being logic errors—are omitted while block programming. However, this does not mean that errors are omitted at large in such environments. In this exploratory case study of a learning environment for early programming (Kodetu), we explored errors in block programming of middle school students (N = 123), using log files drawn from a block-based online. Analyzing 1033 failed executions, we found that errors may be driven by either learners' knowledge and behavior, or by the learning environment design. The rate of error types was not associated with the learners' and contextual variables examined, with the exception of task complexity (as defined by SOLO taxonomy). Our findings highlight the importance of learning from errors and of learning environment design.

Personal and behavioral data have become valuable material for statistical and machine learning techniques that have the potential to profile, infer, and predict people's needs, values, and behavior. As a response, researchers are calling for data literacies and computational thinking to facilitate people's capacity and volition to make informed actions in their digital world. Yet, efforts and curricula towards a greater understanding of computational mechanisms of new media ecology are sorely missing from K12-education as well as from teacher education.

In applying survival analysis to a sample of more than 20,000 participants from one popular computer science MOOC, we found that students' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC. Moreover, we discovered that precomputational thinking skills, programming experience, and gender, which were previously considered to be constant predictors of students' retention, have effects that attenuate over the course milestones. This finding suggests that MOOC educators should take a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger. Lay Description: What is already known about this topicMOOCs have very low retention rates, ranging between 1% to 15%.Background and engagement factors have been shown to predict MOOC dropout.Precomputational thinking style has been shown to predict computer science performance, but no research has investigated its effect on retention in either traditional classrooms or in MOOCs.Auto‐adaptive feedback is a quickly and widely adopted assistant feature in MOOCs, particularly in computer science, but its impact on retention is not well understood.What this paper addsStudents' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC.This study identified predictors of dropout whose effects did not diminish over time, including foreign status, gaming hours on the computer, self‐reported extrovert personality, and motivation.This study discovered predictors of dropout whose effects were seen early in the course, but diminished in importance over the milestone sequence. These predictors were gender, age, precomputational thinking skills, and prior computer science experience.Implications for practice and/or policyDesign a gradual learning curve for beginners so that they can adapt to the course mindset and framework.Assure students who are frustrated in the beginning of the course that once they adapt to the course mindset, their lack of background knowledge will not define their future experience and persistence.Assisted with the auto‐adaptive feedback features, multiple trials in the course assignment can be an engaging and rewarding experience.MOOCs should develop pedagogies that explicitly encourage student to use a trial‐and‐error strategy, testing different scenarios and experimenting with different solutions, to make the most use of auto‐adaptive feedback features.MOOC educators should not only take a growth perspective towards students' knowledge and skill development, but also a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger.

This research aims to investigate how secondary school girls perceive CT practices – the problem-solving practices that students apply while they are engaged in programming – when using the micro:bit device in a collaborative setting. This study also explores the collaborative programming process of secondary school girls with the micro:bit device. We conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of Victoria, Australia) and 31 mentors attending a girls-only CT program (OzGirlsCT program). The girls were grouped into 52 teams and collaboratively developed computational solutions around realistic, important problems to them and their communities. We distributed two surveys (with 193 responses each) to the girls. Further, we surveyed the mentors (with 31 responses) who monitored the girls, and collected their observation reports on their teams Our study indicates that the girls found ""debugging"" the most difficult type of CT practice to apply, while collaborative practices of CT were the easiest. We found that prior coding experience significantly reduced the difficulty level of only one CT practice - ""debugging"". Our study also identified six challenges the girls faced and six best practices they adopted when working on their computational solutions. • Debugging is the most difficult CT practice for secondary school girls to apply. • CT collaborative practices are the easiest practices for secondary school girls. • Secondary school girls face six challenges when programming with the micro:bit. • School secondary girls adopt six best practices to address these challenges.

However, there is little understanding of whether children are developmentally ready to think computationally and what specific CT concepts and skills can be developed at various ages. This study explored the developmental and gender differences in CT skills of 197 Grade 4–6 students (aged 9–13) before being exposed to instruction and investigated the age–gender interaction effects on their CT acquisition in an intervention combining both programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities. Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender. Implications for practice and research in CT education were discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the topic: Learning progressions for computational thinking have been defined in K‐12 curricula globally.Engaging in programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities can increase students' CT skills.Controversial results have been reported on the age–gender interaction effects on CT development.Lack of understanding on children's actual progressive development of CT. What this paper adds: A developmental progression was found in CT skills of students aged 9–13. Students aged 12 and above had some a priori understanding of CT.No gender difference across ages existed in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills before instruction.Students aged 9–11 benefitted the most from an intervention combining both programming and unplugged activities compared to older students. Students' CT acquisition in the intervention was unaffected by gender.Given the intervention, students aged 9 and above developed conditionals, logical operators and pattern recognition skills. However, generalization skill was developed only for students aged 12 and above. Implications for practice and policy: The findings lay the foundation for designing evidence‐based age‐appropriate CT learning progression and pedagogies.Age‐appropriate learning content: Given appropriate learning experiences, students aged 9 and above may be ready to learn certain CT concepts and skills, including conditionals, logical operators and pattern recognition.CT pedagogies: Using programming and unplugged activities to develop CT requires careful consideration of students' cognitive development and gender needs.

The researchers in this study provided a flexible means of ubiquitous learning (u-learning) with a mobile app for students to access the learning material. In addition, the authors also adopted computational thinking (CT) to help students develop practical computing skills. Three classes of first-year students were chosen for the empirical study. They were divided into three groups: two experimental groups (CT&UL group and CT group) and one control group. According to the results in this study, students who received the treatment of u-learning could have significantly better computing skills in using PowerPoint and Word than those without. However, the treatment of web-mediated CT did not result in better development of students’ computing skills in this research. Finally, the researchers expect that this study provides a design and illustration of CT in a u-learning environment for schools and educators.

This integration can be done in many different ways. However, it is still unclear which teaching methods work in which situations. To provide some clarity in this area, we compared two methods of integrating programming into a primary robotics workshop for learners aged ten to twelve. In one method, students create programs from scratch; in the other, they start with a faulty program they have to fix. These teaching methods were evaluated using the framework of learning ecology, which provides a holistic framework for assessing complex learning environments. We identified different indicators of learning ecology and assessed our workshops using a mixed‐methods approach. Our results showed no difference between the groups on the intrinsic dimension of a learning ecology. However, on the experiential dimension, the learners in the create group scored better on all tests. Our results show the value of a multidimensional assessment of learning ecology to understand different teaching techniques. Additionally, the results provide us with important insights on how to integrate programming into a primary robotics curriculum enabling teachers to select better methods for teaching computing in their classroom. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: More and more countries are adding programming and computational thinking to their primary school curriculaTeacher need practical, efficient and effective ways to integrate programming into their coursesTeachers often opt for scaffolding techniques when teaching programming, however there is no conclusive research about which techniques work in which situations What this paper adds?: This research compares two methods for integrating programming into primary roboticsThese methods are evaluated using the intrinsic and experiential dimensions of learning ecology to get a deeper understanding of the underlying learning processesWe show that using learning ecology as a framework for learning can give deeper insights into learning practiceOur experiments show that integrating programming should preferably be done by letting learners create programs from scratch and not fix programs with errors Implications for practice and/or policy: Provide teachers with insights into the effects of different integration methods for programmingAllowing teachers to reason about why certain techniques are less effective than othersHanding teachers a framework for assessing the way they choose to integrate programming into their curriculum [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Computer Assisted Learning is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master’s degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master’s degree are shown. This overall approach has been refined through the Master’s life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme.

In this paper, we review conceptualisations of, and approaches to, the activity of pedagogic design and highlight the implications for the provision of computational support for this activity. We then outline different ways in which that support has been implemented in three digital tools: Phoebe, the LAMS Activity Planner and the Learning Designer. We consider the challenges to, and implications of, deploying these tools from the perspectives of three groups of stakeholders: developers, teachers and institutions. Our findings suggest that, while such tools are acceptable in principle, they face a number of technological and socio-cultural challenges to their acceptability from teachers’ perspectives and to their deployment within institutional strategies for teaching and learning in a digital age.

Initially using a mixed-methods approach, a five-step model was conceptualized. Thereafter, a panel of five academic experts gave input into the model's design from which the model was expanded to include six related learning environments. The instrument used in the research was a problem-based assessment form. Data collection was carried out utilizing group chats and analyzed using descriptive statistics including the mean and standard deviation. The results of the study revealed that the initial model contained five steps including (1) problem identification, (2) problem analysis, (3) research, (4) presentations, and (5) summary and evaluation, which is integrated into the model's additional six learning environment elements. These six learning environments were (1) problem-based, (2) resources, (3) cognitive tools, (4) collaboration, (5) scaffolding, and finally, (6) coaching. When applying the proposed model and related environments, there was a consensus from the experts that the model had excellent suitability and can be used as a model for teaching and learning at the bachelor's degree level.

However, the output-based assessment in BBPL learning is insufficient as we can not understand how students learn and what mistakes they have had. This study aims to propose a data-driven method that provides insight into students' problem-solving process in a game-based BBPL practice. Based on a large-scale programing dataset generated by 131,770 students in solving a classical maze game with BBPL in Hour of Code, we first conducted statistical analysis to extract the most common mistakes and correction trajectories students had. Furthermore, we proposed a novel program representation method based on tree edit distance of abstract syntax tree to represent students' programing trajectories, then applied a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to find the hidden patterns behind these trajectories. The experimental results revealed four qualitatively different clusters: quitters, approachers, solvers and knowers. The further statistical analysis indicated the significant difference on the overall performance among different clusters. This work provides not only a new method to represent students' programing trajectories but also an efficient approach to interpret students' final performance from the perspective of programing process.

Teachers' intuitive perspectives about optimal learning processes – ""folk psychology"" – impact their perspectives about teaching ""folk pedagogy"" and play a significant role in integrating educational technologies, such as visual programming, within the formal curriculum. This study was conducted based on the mixed method research paradigm. First, a folk pedagogy questionnaire was distributed to 89 teachers who integrate differing technologies in their classroom in order to identify the teachers' pedagogical perspectives: constructivist versus instructivist. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 teachers who teach Scratch in order to gain a deeper understanding of their instructivist/constructivist perspectives and actual pedagogical practices and strategies. Finally, we analyzed 96 students' programming artifacts to explore differences, if any, in students' outcomes related to the pedagogical perspectives of their teachers. Findings revealed that pedagogical perspectives are reflected in teaching strategies and assessment practices employed in a visual programming environment. It is promising that teaching visual programming promoted constructivist pedagogy even among instructivist teachers and was consequently reflected in student perspectives and expressed in their programming artifacts. We discuss theoretical and educational implications of these findings.

Many studies have shown that this has significantly led to the change in cognition of design environments in academia. Design decisions are made through a recursive process that is cyclically refined by allowing constant feedback and testing. This paper represents an observational study with an aim to understand the impact of digital mediums on design processes and design outcomes focusing on associative modeling using VPL. It contextualizes the difference, the associative modeling system as a parametric subset brings to design thinking when used as a medium to explore architectural design. It analyzes specific attributes of associative modeling, otherwise native to computational thinking, that contribute to the legibility of the design process. The paper demonstrates how associative modeling allows the design process to be examined and edited at any stage during and even after algorithmic development, bringing in flexibility. It is argued that digital design tool affordances enable students to develop multilayered and more structured design logic that augments cognition bringing more legibility to the design thinking process.

This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.

In the case of information systems‐related courses, students focus on system development using specific languages and frameworks while often disregard the required logical checks and constraints. This paper introduces annotated functional decomposition (AFD) to assist students in overcoming the challenge of understanding the logic of an information system. AFD leverages methodological concepts from computational thinking and represents a problem decomposition approach that is extended with additional levels of decomposition. These levels of decomposition are orthogonal and implemented with annotations that enrich a decomposition with information regarding control and data flow, as well as reuse and implementation details. AFD could be exercised with a supporting AFD Tool developed as an Eclipse IDE plugin that performs syntax and semantic checks along with the generation of UML sequential diagrams. The AFD Tool and its source code are available free of charge. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of AFD Tool usage during an information systems course revealed that students who used AFD achieved higher average grades than those who used UML for solving the same problems, and moreover that students perceived AFD as easy to understand and use.

Especially, robotics technologies offer opportunities for young age children, for a practical, hands-on understanding of the things they meet in their daily life but do not fully understand, such as proximity sensors, motion detectors, and light sensors, reasoning failures (software bugs) and connection problems (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth disconnection). In this article, we presented robots that can be used in early childhood and first primary classes of education. The purpose of this article is not to advocate against an educational robot or robotic kit but indeed to inform the educational community so that to make informed decisions regarding the introduction of this kind of technology into the classroom.

However, the standard K-10 curriculum does not always contain accessible technology that uses interactive teaching methods and efficient analytical skill development. Also, most practical computational thinking applications that are being created seem to be complex and expensive for educational settings. In this work, we introduce PlutoAR, a marker-based augmented reality (AR) interpreter that is scalable, inexpensive, portable, and can be used as a platform for kids to enhance their skills in an inclusive way. PlutoAR incorporates AR through an interactive toolkit to give students the experiences of both the real and virtual worlds, overcoming the limitations of traditional and non-interactive setups. With the help of technology-based solutions, this effort intends to enable students from all demographic groups to engage in the learning process, regardless of their level of competence. The PlutoAR mobile application presently runs on any Android device with a camera. It creates inbuilt AR experiences like stories, basic elementary mathematics, navigating mazes utilising conditional loops to solve them, and the intuition of gravity. The usability of the PutoAR application is verified by performing the qualitative and quantitative analysis through user feedback. The application seems to be acceptable by users with a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of more than 80. In future, we intend to provide flexibility to the user for adding new content inside the application whenever needed and to promote AR-based collaboration among the students.

The research questions are (a) How can teachers be grouped according to their perceived SW knowledge/skills and pedagogical beliefs? (b) What are the overall trends in teachers' stages of concern about SW education? and (c) How are the stages of concern about SW education distributed according to the different teacher types? The participants were 207 teachers who completed the online survey. Data were collected about their perceived SW knowledge/skills, pedagogical beliefs, and the seven stages of concern related to SW education. First, K-means clustering was performed to categorize teachers into four types based on their SW knowledge/skills and pedagogical beliefs. Overall, our findings indicate that 40% of the participants belonged to Type I, who have high SW knowledge/skills and pedagogical beliefs. Second, the concerns profile in Type I showed an M pattern in which they hold both self and impact concerns. Types II--IV showed a similar trend, such that the trends peak at Stage 0 (Awareness) and the intense concerns at the selflevel (Stage 1, Informational and Stage 2, Personal). All types demonstrated a tailing up phenomenon at Stage 6 (Refocusing). This study has implications for the design of concern-based interventions and makes suggestions to enable teachers to move toward more advanced levels to adopt computational thinking-based pedagogy in SW education.

The article beings with positioning the OER within wider pedagogical debates in the digital humanities. The OER is built from our research encounters and committed to computational thinking rather than technicalities. Furthermore, we argue that students best learn with the 'whole game' methodology. Learners need to be exposed to meaningful activities as soon and as far as possible. The article presents two examples that implement our approach. The first introduces Python as a data analysis language to students of the humanities. It is different because it concentrates on the principles of the computational thinking behind data analysis rather than programming details. The second example takes the students into the world of machine learning and the whole game of social and cultural research with it. Students learn useful skills such as web scraping but will also run their own machine learning algorithms to follow concrete research questions.

Predominantly African-American students engaged in engineering and computer science tasks during informal learning environments. Results revealed students' self-efficacy scores on computer gaming increased significantly. Focus group data supported these findings, revealing that computer programing was challenging, but students enjoyed the tasks, added elements of culture in some cases, and valued the agency the tasks provided. Focal students were also able to make connections to STEM-related careers. Observational data demonstrated that focal students exhibited substantive CT during robotics and moderate CT during game design. Results support the idea that robotics and game design may be used to broaden underrepresented students' participation in STEM.

While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players' qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work. • Design and evaluation procedures for an Augmented Reality-based serious game to teach programming are presented. • An empirical study with twenty-seven undergraduate students is conducted. • Students with lesser prior programming skills show significant improvement after playing the game. • A Game Learning Analytics framework is incorporated in the game for various stakeholder benefits. • Suggestions and implications for future work are presented.

It is a fun and engaging learning activity that encourages students to collaborate, delve into a problem, construct knowledge, and cultivate critical thinking. Educational robotics is therefore an innovative teaching tool, which contributes to the implementation of the above goal and follows the principles of building, specifically the construction of knowledge (Mikropoulos & Bellou, 2010). It develops students' critical thinking, strengthens their mental models, and activates known learning mechanisms leading them to a deeper level of understanding and assimilation of knowledge, which cannot be accomplished with traditional teaching methodologies. It has also been proven to be able to help students solve complex problems as well as contribute to the development of computational thinking skills (Atmatzidou & Demetriadis, 2014), which should characterize the entire literate population and complement the other three basic reading skills, writing, and mathematics (Mavroudis, Petrou & Fesakis, 2014).

This paper explores CT’s usefulness to sustainability science through the application of the services-oriented architecture (SOA). The SOA is a popular organizational framework in information technology that enables businesses to describe the services they offer, including how, where, to whom, and under what terms these services are available to consumers. It provides a straightforward, scalable, and portable way to describe and organize complex business systems, with an emphasis on system controls and component interactions rather than on the system components themselves. Here, we present the SOA as a path to a more mature ecosystem services concept, in support of integrated assessment frameworks such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). With the SOA we capture important interrelationships among ecosystems, ecosystem service consumers, and ecosystem service governance authorities, particularly the effects of their interactions on the viability of ecosystem services. By standardizing the description and relationships involving ecosystem services, the SOA supports a diagnostic approach for evaluating stability and change in ecosystem service use across both space and time, when influenced by drivers of social, political, and/or ecological change, whether directional or stochastic, planned or otherwise. We present here a prototype of the SOA and illustrate its utility with an example from rural Alaskan communities.

Children (N = 35) aged between 9 and 11 years old completed a protocol of twelve coding and robotics sessions at a rate of three sessions per week, in groups of five. The sessions presented in an enjoyable and motivating environment gave the children the opportunity to play, tinker, create and solve problems while collaborating with each other. A repeated measures plan was used and the progress in attentional inhibition was measured by psychometric tests and by structured observations. After training phase, children exhibited a better performance (p value equal to 0.003) in attentional inhibition than after control phase (p value equal to 0.041). The significant progress revealed promising results towards the development of attentional inhibition through coding and robotics group sessions.

The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.

This case study presents students’ opinions about their participation in a 3D multiuser game-like environment, by harnessing Second Life in combination with the two-dimensional (2D) programming environment of Scratch4SL. Following a blended instructional format (face-to-face in a computer laboratory and supplementary online courses), 56 students utilizing Scratch4SL participated in this study, with a view to reduce the “steep learning curve” created during their first-time entrance into Second Life. This study identifies Papert’s theory of Constructionism as a potentially appropriate theoretical foundation for the development of an instructional framework, in order to assist students to coordinate and manage learning materials with other teammates, using their computational thinking skills in collaborative problem-based programming tasks. The study findings based on a mixed-method research (a close-ended questionnaire and an open-ended interview) indicated the effectiveness of this “constructionist-oriented” instructional process for students’ engagement to acquire or empower social, cognitive, higher-order, and computational thinking skills.

The Bebras contest on informatics, which originated 12 years ago and now involves around 50 countries, consists of short problem-solving tasks based on topics in informatics. Bebras tasks engender the development of computational thinking skills by incorporating abstraction, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, evaluation and generalization. Bebras tasks cover a range of informatics concepts including algorithms and data structures, programming, networking, databases and social and ethical issues. Having built up a substantial number of Bebras tasks over 12 years it is important to be able to categorize them so that they can be easily accessed by the Bebras community and teachers within schools. The categorization of tasks within Bebras is important as it ensures that tasks span a wide range of topics; there have been several categorization schemes suggested to date. In this paper we present a new two-dimensional categorization system that takes account of computational thinking skills as well as content knowledge. Examples are given from recent tasks that illustrate the role that Bebras can play in the development of computational thinking skills.

To this end, two studies have been carried out. The first one involves a survey about how ecology-related and computational design courses complement the architectural design studio at different universities in Turkey. The second one, which is the main study of this paper, presents the results of an ecology-based computational design workshop. According to the results of the first study, computer-based design courses in Turkey usually lack the dimension of ""computational thinking"", focusing only on computer-aided design tools. Moreover, we have also found out that ecology courses in Turkish architectural education are mostly elective, and hence, have only very indirect connection to the architectural design studio. In the second study, we have demonstrated how incorporating computational thinking into the design process increase students' awareness of the ecological dimension and their ability to make this dimension an integral part of their projects. The paper concludes by elaborating on the importance of computational methods in architectural education.

Educational robotics offers a possible approach. However, innovations can only find their way into the classroom if teachers find them feasible and meaningful. Thus, appropriate training and further education of teachers are becoming a necessity. This paper reports on investigating professional development for teachers in programming robots by integrating the method of storytelling in their teaching. It draws on the Technology Usage Inventory (TUI) model to explore how an interdisciplinary intervention with programmable robots, combined with the storytelling method Tell, Draw & Code can influence the intention to use them in the classroom. Comparing the pre-and post-test and the qualitative data analysis shows a significant increase in positive attitudes towards the use of robots. The learning scenarios produced by the participants show how implementation can succeed. These findings highlight the need for teachers to explore, reflect, and experience the potential of new technologies as part of their teacher development to implement innovations sustainably. The quasi-experimental study shows that this problem-based and interdisciplinary didactic setting is particularly well received by teachers because it promotes computational thinking, narrative, and reading skills in primary school students in equal measure, and it can be easily taught and transferred.

There are some studies investigating the effectiveness of Scratch for K-12 level education. However, studies that have been conducted at the collegiate level, especially in the context of preservice computing teacher education, are very rare. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Scratch-based instruction on preservice teachers’ understanding of basic programming concepts and their attitudes toward programming. In the present study, a mixed method design was utilized. In the first phase of the study, the data were collected using an achievement test, a practice test, and a computer programming attitude scale. In the second phase of the study, data were collected through a semistructured interview. The results of the study indicated that preservice teachers in Scratch-based instruction had significantly better understanding of basic computing concepts. Qualitative data indicated that Scratch-based instruction was useful in constructing a more meaningful learning environment for preservice teachers. The results of this study have implications for researchers and preservice computing teacher educators when designing an introductory computing course.

STEAM education offers a number of benefits, such as improved problem analysis and solving skills, as well as the development of creative abilities. Many researchers reiterate the importance of STEAM-related activities and programs, especially the integration of maker education. Despite much interest in STEAM, it is often challenging for many educators to incorporate integrated activities into their teaching practice. This paper deals with the value of STEAM integration in a methodological sense, with a focus on the maker's laboratory and physical computing, as well as the application of design thinking and computational thinking approaches. Motivation and Objectives: The goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for integrated STEM curricula focusing on the following research questions: (a) how to improve daily activities of STEM education by combining the activities of different laboratories and using a design thinking approach? and (b) how to combine FabLab activities and physical computing related to teaching different aspects of computational thinking in the context of STEM? Research Methodology and Methods: As a research methodology, we implement a mixed methods strategy to combine theoretical study and empirical research based on a synthesized literature survey and the process of iterative model development based on an observational case study. We conduct a detailed case study of two applications of integrated activities based on FabLab and physical computing integration, and illustrate how design thinking can guide teachers to open up for interdisciplinary, creative, and project-based opportunities. Results and Findings: The paper provides a conceptual framework for STEM integration activities and step-by-step guidelines on how design thinking methods could could interact in practice. The implications of the results may be useful for educators seeking recommendations for the integration process, which enable educators to design hands-on activities and incorporate integrated aspect of students' STEAM learning into teaching practice. In conclusions, the authors suggest that as interdisciplinary crossroads, design thinking provides a natural bridge between subjects, and fits especially to integrate activities of the maker's labs and physical computing, focusing on the integration of computational thinking and computational making approaches within STEM education environment. The absence of a statistical evaluation, which is positioned as a further research step, may be mentioned as a limitation of the study.

A modelling approach was proposed to provide guidance to students in implementing solutions for scientific problems in computer programming. This modelling approach includes five stages: (1) phenomenon description, (2) data modelling, (3) algorithmic modelling, (4) coding, and (5) verification and debugging. Authentic scenarios for science learning were adopted in teaching materials and problems to inspire students to learn both the scientific and programming aspects of the underneath phenomena. An empirical experiment to examine the effectiveness of the proposed instruction was conducted in a general education course at a university, and the results showed that students who engaged more in the modelling approach performed better in both the program implementation test and their final projects. In addition, students' feedback agreed with what we had expected the modelling approach would benefit students: they could connect abstract, real-world phenomena to programming variables and logic by visualizing the phenomena in simulation and animation. Data modelling and algorithmic modelling also helped them analyze the variables in the problem space and propose a solution before coding. Because the proposed instruction provided opportunities to experience the capability of programming in solving scientific problems, high-programming-performance students also showed a greater interest in exploring science after the class.

Memorizing a book or one-way communication is incapable of fully developing all the skills required. Along with changes in the new curriculum structure in the computational science courses which are aimed to improve computational thinking skills. In Thailand, students do not have enough experience in calculation methods. Teachers must therefore provide instruction in a format that promotes computational thinking and the skills necessary for the 21st century. The sample was 400 students from public and private schools in the same amount to develop the model, which was calculated based on the population of high school students throughout Bangkok, Thailand. It was found that the current learning model was unable to develop computational thinking concepts and 21st century skills. Therefore, the researchers have the concept of developing a teaching model that focuses on problem-solving along with the use of a design thinking approach in a virtual learning environment. To enable students with no experience with computational thinking skills to develop computational thinking skills to a competent standard. The objective is to also develop other skills, which are essential skills in the 21st century at the same time.

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community. [Display omitted] • The miniOS class integrates OS education with hands-on, project-based learning. • Over nine years, it has engaged 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students. • It enhances skills in system software design, computational thinking, and teamwork. • Voluntary participation and mentorship foster a deeper understanding and passion for OS.

Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with 'code smells' such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game's efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games.

However, few of them support collaborative learning or programming. Little is known about children's experiences, emotional states and behaviours on collaborative programming. Motivated by this gap, we present a novel tangible and collaborative enabled programming system named Lighters, which designed for children aged 7–10 and had two types of collaboration modes (block-based and role-based). We conducted an user experiment with 24 children, and collected physiological (EDA), questionnaire, video recording and interview data for analysis. Based on our experiment results, Lighters are effective in helping children learn to program collaboratively. In addition, Lighters can mobilize children's positive emotions and enthusiasm to learn programming. Compared with block-based collaboration, role-based collaboration is more likely to stimulate children's emotional states and has a better effect on learning programming.

The goal of this study is to propose a teaching scenario using Scratch in primary schools, based on active pedagogical methods that prioritize the student's role in the teaching- learning process. Through this scenario, students will work in groups of three to solve problems and propose solutions using the ""trial and error"" method. As they try to detect and correct errors in their programs, they will be able to develop their problem-solving and investigative skills in a collaborative and motivating environment. Overall, the proposed scenario combines active teaching approaches with the nature of the subject matter, empowering students to take an active role in their own learning.

This paper introduces KNIME as a low-code programming platform for linguists interested in learning text analytic methods, while highlighting the considerations necessary from a linguistics standpoint for data scientists. Examples from an Open Educational Resource created for the DiMPAH project are used to demonstrate KNIME's value as a low-code option for text analysis, using sentiment analysis and topic modelling as examples. The paper provides detailed step-by-step descriptions of the workflows for both methods, showcasing how these methods can be applied without writing code. The results suggest that visual or low-code programming tools are useful as an introduction for linguists and humanities scholars who wish to gain an understanding of text analytic workflows and computational thinking. However, as with more traditional programming, caution must be exercised when using methods without fully understanding them. In conclusion, KNIME is a potential avenue for innovative research and teaching computational methods to humanities scholars.

These activities do enhance the participatory dimensions of CS, but whether they also support broadening the participation of underrepresented youth remains unclear. While online communities that are dedicated to computational participation have existed in the U.S. for over a decade, many communities of color remain underrepresented in CS disciplines. How might CS educators, researchers, and technologists promote culturally responsive forms of computational participation? To answer this question, we propose a culturally responsive framework for computational participation called generative computing. Generative computing approaches CS as a means for strengthening relationships between learning environments and local communities, leveraging culturally relevant sources of wealth generation in technology design and implementation. To explore this concept, we conducted a mixed-methods study with a cosmetology high school program that predominantly serves young African-American women. Through a series of computationally and culturally rich cosmetology projects, we tested our hypothesis that generative computing can enhance connections between Black heritage, CS, and cosmetology while supporting students' academic interests and knowledge.

In the study, two consecutive experimental cases were conducted to examine the consistency of findings. The research sample comprises 81 tenth‐grade students undergoing vocational secondary education. A total of 41 students participated in the first case that spanned 12 weeks, and 40 students participated in the second that spanned 8 weeks. After computational activities, the programming achievement scores significantly increased in all test groups. However, the achievement scores did not differ significantly between the groups. For the comparison groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the pre‐ and posttest scores of the formal and descriptive abstraction in both cases. However, a statistically significant increase was found in the formal (only Case 2) and descriptive abstraction scores of the students in the experimental groups. The abstraction results revealed a significant difference in the descriptive abstraction scores of Case 2 in favour of the experimental group. No statistically significant difference was found in the problem‐solving scores within or between groups. In both cases, the motivation scores of the experimental groups were found to be statistically higher than those of the comparison groups. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Programming activities that encourage how to think rather than what to think, have the potential to be effective instructional tools for cognitive processes.Despite the increasing research trend in computer science education, especially Computational Thinking (CT), there is a lack of studies investigating abstraction.Most of the studies on CT are based on a single cross‐sectional study shaped by relatively short‐term instructional activities and narrow‐scoped computational concepts. What this paper adds?: This study examined the effects of two programming modalities on tenth‐grade students' learning, intellectual skills, and motivation.Two consecutive interventions were conducted in order to examine the consistency of the findings.Robot programming is as effective as object‐oriented programming in the acquisition of programming concepts.Robot programming enhanced students' descriptive abstraction and motivation more effectively.Programming did not lead to any significant changes in students' problem‐solving approaches to daily‐life problems. Implications for practice and/or policy: The use of manipulative robotics can enrich learning outcomes in programming education.Robotic activities support the development of descriptive abstraction skills better than object‐oriented programming.Robotic technologies have great potential to increase student motivation regardless of the novelty effect.Problems used in programming activities should be chosen more relevant to the authentic world scenarios to connect computational approaches with daily life problems.Educational robots can be used as alternative tools to embody computational concepts in programming education.

Here, we test the effects of units with different programming content within a virtual robotics context on both learning gains and motivational changes in middle school (6th–8th grade) robotics classrooms. Significant learning gains were found overall, particularly for groups introduced to content involving program flow, the structural logic of program execution. Relative gains for these groups were particularly high on items that require the transfer of knowledge to dissimilar contexts. Reaching units that included program flow content was also associated with greater maintenance of programming interest when compared with other units. Therefore, our results suggest that explicit instruction in the structural logic of programming may develop deeper transferrable programming knowledge and prevent declines in some motivational factors.

In this study, we report on the implementation of a digital portfolio with a class of 21 high school students used to capture the process of creating of an electronic textile mural project. While students' understanding of computational concepts were only partially captured within the portfolios, their engagements with computational practices – such as debugging and iteration – were better highlighted. Much of this was due to the students' existing communicative strategies themselves, both in terms of how precise they were in describing issues, as well as how they leveraged images and code to explain their process. Recommendations for designing more effective portfolio assessments are discussed, which include greater emphasis on creating shared classroom discourse, and leveraging students' existing experiences with multimedia.

Besides, the 3D game development is a difficult and complex learning process. Within this context, it was decided that teaching should be restructured to support the metacognitive strategies' use skills of students. SOLO taxonomy was used as a framework for restructuring the content of teaching. In the literature, SOLO is preferred as a solution for teaching contents, which is complex and challenging to learn. The aim of this study is to improve problem-solving skills (PSS), cognitive flexibility, meta-cognitive strategies use skills and spatial anxiety in teaching the 3D game development, supported with metacognitive strategies and restructured with SOLO. An embedded pattern is used in this study. This study showed that experimental intervention influences change in students' PSS and metacognitive strategies use skills. It is necessary to include SOLO taxonomy in content planning to increase the learning performance. It is supposed that the study results will provide an insight for implementers to design and execute difficult and complex teaching in computer science education and will assist them in developing different perspectives.

Forty 4th–6th grade children with basic programming knowledge of Scratch were randomly assigned to either a pair-programming or solo-programming condition. Overall, children in both conditions enjoyed the online learning activity and completed it successfully. In particular, pair-programming seemed to entail an extra benefit to girls who generally preferred working in pairs. Nevertheless, children in the pair condition took longer to complete all tasks, perceived the third task, which was completed individually, as more difficult, and were less active when their partner was more competent.

The development of these scales stemmed from the elusive nature of attitude and the lack of specific constructs to measure attitude. These instruments measure students' attitudes based on one‐dimensional perspective, thus, making it difficult to interpret the meaning of some attitude evaluations such as the meaning of neutral points in a 10‐point scale (for example). Objectives: The computer programming attitude scale was modified to measure ambivalence. The study also investigate attitude differences across demographic variables and used these variables to predict ambivalence. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the instrument was validated using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. In the second phase, the revised scale was administered to another 547 students in four research universities for empirical investigation. Results: Results show that the instrument is valid and suitable for measuring students' programming attitudes. Participants' attitudes skewed toward the negative attitude dimension. Lastly, we found that both attitude and ambivalence are factors of programming experience. Conclusions: We discussed the findings, recommend the instrument to programming tutors, and strongly emphasise the evaluation of students' ambivalent attitudes. Lay Description: What is currently known: There are numerous scales developed to measure students' attitude toward computer programming, such as the computer programming attitude scale (CPAS).The development of these inventories stemmed from the elusive nature of attitude and the lack of specific construct to measure attitude.These instruments measure students' attitude based on one dimensional perspective, thus, making it difficult to interpret the meaning of some attitude evaluations such as the meaning of neutral points in a 10‐point scale (for example). What this paper adds: The present research brings a novel approach to instrument development by acknowledging the presence of attitude toward computer programming.This novel approach advances the knowledge of instrument development in the field of attitude measurement by introducing a paradigm shift from conventional attitude evaluation to a more diverse approach.The study has introduced new items to the existing CPAS, and subsequently, indicates the possibility of validating an attitude inventory using data obtained from ambivalence evaluation.By using this instrument, students' attitude is measured accurately rather than adopting the conventional measures that ignored the presence of negative and positive evaluations. Implication to practitioners: Through the findings of the study, computer science and programming educators would come to know that many positive and negative attitude elements are occasionally subsumed toward an attitude object, thereby leading to an ambivalence attitude.The instrument can be used by the practitioners to accurately measure students' positive and negative attitude toward programming across all levels of education.Using the instrument, practitioners can predict the identified attitude using wide range of variables such as gender, age, computational thinking skills, programming proficiency levels, among others.

Computational Thinking (CT) and Agile Values (AV) focus respectively on the individual capability to think algorithmically, and on the principles of collaborative software development. Although these two dimensions of software engineering education complement each other, very few studies explored their interaction. In this paper we use an exploratory Structural Equation Modeling technique to introduce and analyze Cooperative Thinking (CooT), a model of team-based computational problem solving. We ground our model on the existing literature and validate it through Partial Least Square modeling. Cooperative Thinking is new competence which aim is to support cooperative problem solving of technical contents suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. This article suggests to tackle the CooT construct as an education goal, to train students of software development to improve both their individual and teaming performances.

This paper aims to identify, characterize, and describe barriers, facilitators, and methodological proposals described by the community to include individuals with ASD in the discipline of Software Engineering. We conducted a comprehensive systematic multivocal mapping study to evaluate the existing evidence on the inclusion of individuals with ASD in Software Engineering. We obtained 34 primary studies from which we identified the main facilitators of motivation to learn new skills, attention to detail, and the ability to report and visualize patterns. In contrast, the main barriers detected were communication, a lack of neurodivergent computational thinking, and sensory integration. Additionally, we identified and classified four categories of proposals that allowed the inclusion of individuals with ASD: (i) using virtual reality, (ii) creating more inclusive workspaces, (iii) encouraging neurodivergent computational thinking, and (iv) improving social skills. This study identifies the principal elements that ought to be taken into consideration when allocating tasks and roles to individuals with ASD in software development.

Computational models of semantic memory allow researchers to quantify associative thinking as movement through a semantic space of concepts. Associative thinking reflects a search process operating on a semantic memory network structure. Highly creative people travel further in semantic space, switch between more semantic subcategories, and make larger leaps between associations. Creativity involves both free associations, in which concepts are spontaneously connected, and goal-directed associations, in which concepts are strategically combined. Free association is relevant for artistic creativity, implicating domain-general cognitive abilities in domain-specific creative expertise. Neuroscience evidence indicates associative thinking engages brain regions involved in both semantic and episodic memory. Creativity has long been thought to involve associative processes in memory: connecting concepts to form ideas, inventions, and artworks. However, associative thinking has been difficult to study due to limitations in modeling memory structure and retrieval processes. Recent advances in computational models of semantic memory allow researchers to examine how people navigate a semantic space of concepts when forming associations, revealing key search strategies associated with creativity. Here, we synthesize cognitive, computational, and neuroscience research on creativity and associative thinking. This Review highlights distinctions between free- and goal-directed association, illustrates the role of associative thinking in the arts, and links associative thinking to brain systems supporting both semantic and episodic memory – offering a new perspective on a longstanding creativity theory.

Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students' debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students' investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students' intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning.

Within the conceptual framework of computational logistics, an attention mechanism oriented hybrid convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network deep learning architecture (AMO-HCR-DLA) is proposed technically to predict the container terminal liner handling conditions that mainly include liner handling time (LHT) and total working time of quay crane farm (TWT-QCF) for a calling liner. Consequently, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computation (CTO-LGC) automation and intelligence are established tentatively by AMO-HCR-DLA. A typical regional container terminal hub of China is selected to design, implement, execute, and evaluate the AMO-HCR-DLA with the actual production data. In the case of severe vibration of LHT and TWT-QCF, while forecasting the handling conditions of 210 ships based on the CTO-LGC running log of four years, the forecasting error of LHT within one hour is more than 97% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours accounts for 89.405%. When predicting the operating conditions of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting deviation of LHT within one hour is more than striking 99% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours reaches up to 94.010% as well. All are far superior to the predicting outcomes by the classical algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. Hence, the AMO-HCR-DLA shows excellent performance for the prediction of CTHS with the low and stable computational consuming.

A digital design strategy enables architects to make informed decisions and better handle the interdisciplinary nature of the discipline, while dealing with various complexities, uncertainties and an infinite number of the potential solutions. One of the main responsibilities of architectural education is to educate students on the breadth of professional opportunities and career paths. Therefore, it is highly important to examine the sufficiency of available digital design courses in the architectural education curriculum. To achieve this, the study examines the curriculum of two architectural programs in the Middle East and compares the findings with award-winning architectural firms in international professional practice from a digital design perspective. In the first step, various cutting-edge technology-driven firms were investigated, then three award-winning firms were subsequently selected and studied using a deliberate review. Secondly, the curriculum of each architecture school was reviewed and the responsible instructors were interviewed through a qualitative method of in-depth interviews; the perceptions and suggestions of eight academic staff members from both schools (four each) were recorded to facilitate an assessment of the status of the integrated digital design methodologies in the architecture education of the intended schools. The findings indicate that the current structures of architecture education curricula cannot match the innovative challenges and social demands of architecture in the digital age. The importance of curriculum review, as well as different incorporation alternatives of the digital design applications, are also suggested.

They also help practice other 21 century skills such as computational thinking, problem solving and teamwork. Unfortunately, learning how to program is tough and can be also frustrating for beginner students. In this work we introduce RoboTIC, a serious game based on gamification and Augmented Reality that facilitates the learning of programming to students in lower levels of the education system by using a novel set of visual metaphors derived from a notation of roads and traffic signs. The architecture that supports RoboTIC has been designed to allow the integration of multimedia components when new programming concepts and techniques must be addressed and to add game levels that enable students to learn incrementally. Experiments have been conducted in a youth center with children who do not have coding skills at all to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. The results show promising conclusions in terms of children's motivation and interest in programming.

Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. Our formal user study shows that with Incremental 3D, the gradual approach to transition from 2D to 3D authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3D games including 3D models, animations, and programming.

Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179–193, 2018. 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and ""hybrid cells"" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.

By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students' enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach.

This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.

The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students’ achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students’ motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students’ grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

However, little is known about the relationship between a teacher’s unique instructional style and their students’ ability to explore and retain programming content. In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from N = 6 teachers and N = 222 Kindergarten through second grade students at six schools across the United States. These teachers and students participated in an investigation of the relationship between teaching styles and student learning outcomes. All participants engaged in a minimum of two lessons and a maximum of seven lessons using the ScratchJr programming environment to introduce coding. Teachers reported on their classroom structure, lesson plan, teaching style and comfort with technology. They also administered ScratchJr Solve It assessments to capture various aspects of students’ programming comprehension, which were analyzed for trends in learning outcomes. Results from this descriptive, exploratory study show that all students were successful in attaining foundational ScratchJr programming comprehension. Statistically significant findings revealed higher programming achievement in students whose educators demonstrated flexibility in lesson planning, responsiveness to student needs, technological content expertise, and concern for developing students’ independent thinking. Implications for research in the development of computational thinking strategies are discussed, as well as suggestions for successfully implementing early childhood classroom interventions with ScratchJr. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Technology & Design Education is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) reports that an increasing share of jobs are focused more heavily on soft skills or a combination of soft and technical skills. The WEF 5‐year survey of most desired job skills highlight the growing focus on the cognitive and relationship‐building aspects of the future workspace. ""Complex Problem Solving"" has topped the list in both the 2015 and 2020 reports. This paper consolidates and proposes a common framework for lifelong learning in the engineering domain, targeted at practical tools that help engineers solve complex problems, think and learn more holistically, and apply that learning to team leadership. Although the work has been focused on engineering roles, it may be generally applied to any domain where complex problem solving is at a premium. The framework identifies five complex problem‐solving competency sets: sensemaking, adaptive and computational thinking, a design mindset, system architecting and communicating, and leading teams through cycles of learning. These competencies are developed through the experience of a learning infrastructure which integrates learning with the work do be done, through facilitating learning and performance in systems thinking, team leadership and personal learning power and self‐leadership. This paper presents the framework, the background research that led to its development, and how it might be delivered through teaching and mentoring on complex projects.

With all that is known regarding the benefits of programming, little is the published evidence showing how high school students can learn basic programming concepts following innovative instructional formats correctly with the respect to gain/enhance their computational thinking skills. This distinction has caused lack of their motivation and interest in Computer Science courses. This case study presents the opinions of twenty-eight (n = 28) high school students who participated voluntarily in a 3D-game-like environment created in Second Life. This environment was combined with the 2D programming environment of Scratch4SL for the implementation of programming concepts (i.e. sequence and concurrent programming commands) in a blended instructional format. An instructional framework based on Papert's theory of Constructionism to assist students how to coordinate or manage better the learning material in collaborative practice-based learning activities is also proposed. By conducting a mixed-method research, before and after finishing several learning tasks, students’ participation in focus group (qualitative data) and their motivation based on their experiences (quantitative data) are measured. Findings indicated that an instructional design framework based on Constructionism for acquiring or empowering students’ social, cognitive, higher order and computational thinking skills is meaningful.

While these moves have generally been associated with a need to engage more young people in technology study, research has hinted at possible benefits from learning to program including fostering general thinking skills. However, little research has been carried out exploring these ideas. This study analysed data collected while 5- and 6-year-old students in a New Zealand primary school were using Scratch Jnr. to learn about basic shapes, as part of a numeracy topic. Analysis combined Brennan and Resnick's (2012) computational thinking skills framework and Krathwohl's (2002) revision of Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate any role general thinking skills played in these students' coding work. Results suggest including basic coding in primary curricula provides teachers with an effective means of exercising their students' general and higher order thinking skills. They build on Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework by including conceptualization as an important element in students' computational work and highlight the role of predictive thinking in debugging code. Findings support historical arguments that more needs to be done to investigate students' cognitive processes when undertaking computational work. Lay description What is already known about the topic: Computational learning is an emerging area of school curricula;, Limited research exists exploring thinking processes within computational learning;, Early studies challenge more recent claims of thinking skill transfer from computational work., What this paper adds: Computational work supports a range of general and higher order thinking skills;, Task design and teacher skills are critical to achieving higher order thinking outcomes from computational work;, Computational work in teams can support collaborative, cooperative and self-management key competencies., Implications for practice and/or policy: Findings broaden the base of empirical support for including computational work in school curricula;, Coding provides an engaging means of exercising complex thinking skills and key competencies in students;, The data methods used provide teachers with visible evidence of students' thinking processes during computational work.

Often HCI teaching is organized as a set of lectures that are useful to learn concepts, but don't increase the design skills of the students. This work reports the results of an educational experience where both learners and teachers were actively involved in a process of knowledge construction and design. This process usually happens in other domains, such as architecture or industrial design, but is not part of most computer science curricula. We chose as project a challenging theme: the design of eco-feedback interfaces that inform people about the consequences of their actions for the environment and help to take decisions for lowering energy consumption. Eco-feedback interfaces are also representative of the gap between the products available on the market and the results of scientific studies, evidenced also by a recent workshop about HCI education. The workshop evidenced a number of pitfalls in HCI education that in our educational experience we tried to overcome with appropriate methodologies. An additional challenging task was the attempt to organize all the design activities taking advantage of a platform for remote learning, stressing its limits. The paper will discuss all these issues, evidencing where the applied methodologies gave good results and where they need further improvements, with the final goal of giving useful advices for HCI educational experiences to come.

Manufacturing companies need engineers with specific profiles and skills in machining. Teachers, who face both worlds, must play an active role in shortening the transition times of students. Recently, barrel-end mills have been the focus of attention of toolmakers and manufacturers due to their excellent production times and surface accuracies. They are outstanding competitors to more traditional ball-end mills in some applications. This study raises the challenge of translating the developed work for this kind of tool from the research domain into the classroom at the University. For this, a software tool proBARR© was developed and used for learning of the subject of manufacturing. This educational software is capable of predicting cutting forces and surface topography in milling with barrel-end mills and was successfully introduced as part of the students' learning process. A software tool was created for the analysis and prediction of cutting forces and surface quality in milling processes with barrel-end mills. This specific problem was addressed from past experience in research projects but was then adapted for academic use. The teachers believe that, if suitably presented to students, the tool provides an excellent opportunity to approach real problems in industry, thus boosting instructions for future engineers. In this way, a pragmatic methodology to computational thinking is presented that transforms traditional difficulties associated with process modeling into more comprehensive tasks, more oriented toward solving specific problems.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

These goals have been generally described in the literature under the termcomputational thinking. In this article, we report on the design, implementation, and outcomes of an after-school program on computational thinking. The program was founded through a partnership between university faculty, undergraduates, teachers, and students. Specifically, we examine how equitable pedagogical practices can be applied in the design of computing programs and the ways in which participation in such programs influence middle school students' learning of computer science concepts, computational practices, and attitudes toward computing. Participants included 52 middle school students who voluntarily attended the 9-week after-school program, as well as four undergraduates and one teacher who designed and implemented the program. Data were collected from after-school program observations, undergraduate reflections, computer science content assessments, programming products, and attitude surveys. The results indicate that the program positively influenced student learning of computer science concepts and attitudes toward computing. Findings have implications for the design of effective learning experiences that broaden participation in computing.

Robot programming may be used to attract students to programming, but the success of this technique is subjected to the availability of robots. Pair and collaborative programming allows students to learn from one another and write efficient programs. Assessment systems help instructors in evaluating programs written by students and provide them with timely feedback.

These efforts require an environment that values the individual student and integrates recent advances from the primary literature in the discipline, experimentally directed research, data collection and analysis, and scientific writing. Current trends shaping these efforts must include critical thinking, experimental testing, computational modeling, and inferential logic. In essence, modern biochemistry and molecular biology education must be informed by, and integrated with, cutting-edge research. This environment relies on sustained research support, commitment to providing the requisite mentoring, access to instrumentation, and state-of-the-art facilities. The academic environment must establish a culture of excellence and faculty engagement, leading to innovation in the classroom and laboratory. These efforts must not lose sight of the importance of multidimensional programs that enrich science literacy in all facets of the population, students and teachers in K-12 schools, nonbiochemistry and molecular biology students, and other stakeholders.

In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets.

We summarize our 35 years of lessons learned for preparing the workforce that can inform efforts to address this challenge. We have pursued a multiprong approach to reach instructors, researchers, professionals, and students on a national scale. Our efforts in scaling up and sustaining activities range from teaching computational thinking through imparting HPC skills. We have been able to scale up these activities through community efforts to share, cooperate, and collaborate. The potential for providing life-long learning to everyone wishing to expand their computational knowledge and skills is greater than any organization can achieve on its own.

They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates ""algorithmic resilience thinking"" to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions. • A flexible computational framework is proposed to model the interactions between the energy, water and food (EWF) sectors. • Advanced techniques in computational intelligence are utilised for the mathematical representation of EWF resource systems. • An iterative algorithm tracks emerging risks in the EWF nexus, and aids in optimal decision-making for risk mitigation. • A case study considers the impact of weather volatility on outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar.

To understand young students' perceptions about their own learning in computer programming, this study aimed to develop an instrument, Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES), for all students above middle school levels. Based on Berland and Lee's computational thinking framework, this study developed the CPSES items at a literacy level and finally the instrument included the five subscales: Logical Thinking, Algorithm, Debug, Control, and Cooperation. An exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were conducted in this study. The reliability alpha was .96 for the overall scale, and ranged from .84 to .96 for the subscales. This study also confirmed the positive correlation between computer programming experience and computer programming self-efficacy. In addition, for low- and middle-experienced learners, significant gender differences were found in two subscales: Algorithm and Debug. The CPSES can be applied as an evaluation tool in computer education, robotics education, as well as integrated STEM or STEAM education in which computer programming was regarded as a part of computer literacy.

Algorithm is introduced early in the English computing curriculum, yet there is limited knowledge of how young pupils view this concept. This paper explores pupils' (aged 10–11) understandings of algorithm following their engagement with 1 year of ScratchMaths, a curriculum designed to develop computational and mathematical thinking skills through learning to program. A total of 181 pupils from 6 schools undertook a set of written tasks to assess their interpretations and evaluations of different algorithms that solve the same problem, with a subset of these pupils subsequently interviewed to probe their understandings in greater depth. We discuss the different approaches identified, the evaluation criteria they used, and the aspects of the concept that pupils found intuitive or challenging, such as simplification and abstraction. The paper ends with some reflections on the implications of the research, concluding with a set of recommendations for pedagogy in developing primary pupils' algorithmic thinking.

Present account of models of computation highlights several topics of importance for the development of new understanding of computing and its role: natural computation and the relationship between the model and physical implementation, interactivity as fundamental for computational modelling of concurrent information processing systems such as living organisms and their networks, and the new developments in logic needed to support this generalized framework.

Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students’ learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.

The lecture module introduces the importance of critical thinking skills by an example case, critical thinking definition and processes, and the application of critical thinking skills in formulation of CFD problems. In the online test module, seven online tests have been developed to enhance the students' understanding of the contents of lectures and practical sessions. Meanwhile, students apply their critical thinking skills to work out some of the tests. In the project module, a student-driven CFD project is designed to help students to apply CFD techniques and critical thinking skills in engineering problems. In the project, students choose their own project topic and problems. They use CFD skills learned in the course and critical thinking skills to critically analyse their problems, identify the important parameters and review results. They apply the critical writing skills to finalise a project report. To the best knowledge of the author, this systematical integration of teaching and enhancement of critical thinking skills in computational fluid dynamics course is innovative.

Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS.

Yet, they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior game experience. This article presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can effectively address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, the authors first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at supporting all students during computer science learning. In early phases of the intervention, male students outpaced female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multiweek classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that gender differences could dissipate over time within collaborative game-based learning experiences in computer science.

OSSCAR provides an open collaborative environment to develop and access educational resources in the form of web applications, for which various deployment methods are discussed and compared. To minimize efforts in the creation and use of new educational material, OSSCAR combines software tools that have emerged as standards with custom domain-specific ones. The technical solutions adopted to create and distribute content are described and motivated on the basis of reliability, sustainability, ease of uptake and use. Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material. Contributions to expand the educational content of the OSSCAR project are welcome.

However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches.

Advances in computational thinking and data science have led to a new era of artificial intelligence systems being engineered to adapt to complex situations and develop actionable knowledge. These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior.

Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. The task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.

With the emergence of new data collection technologies, advanced data mining and analytics support, there seems to be fundamental changes that are occurring with the research questions we can ask, and the research methods we can apply. The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions.

However, the object-oriented concept, one of the important computational thinking skills, is not represented well in Scratch. Alice, another visual programming language, seems to have better illustration of the object-oriented concept for programming novices. To demonstrate effects of Alice and Scratch, we compared students' responses to both visual programming languages, especially for students with low performances, in an introductory programming course. The relationships among learning engagement, learning anxiety, and learning playfulness were explored.

In this study, we examine whether pair programming is effective in K–12, what it is effective for, and how partners influence each other. We collected the data from 320 middle school students working alone or with a partner on a game programming task. Compared to working alone, pair programming was advantageous for computational thinking and for building programming knowledge, particularly among less experienced students. Students’ initial computer experience and attitude toward collaboration influenced their partners. Those with more experience relative to their partner achieved greater computer confidence and more positive attitudes toward computing. When students had a more positive attitude toward collaboration (relative to their partner), their programming knowledge decreased. We discuss implications for pairing students and for future research.

The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking.

First, we propose a knowledge space distance to measure the distance between any two layers in a multi-granularity knowledge space with superset-subset relationships, and the rationality of the knowledge space distance is verified by theory and experiment. Second, relying on the knowledge space distance and knowledge space distance variance, we propose two algorithms (i.e., a deterministic algorithm and a heuristic algorithm) to select an approximate equidistant k -layer multi-granularity knowledge space. Third, in addition to verifying the effectiveness of the knowledge space distance, the knowledge space distance variance, the deterministic algorithm and the heuristic algorithm, we verify that the equidistant k -layer multi-granularity knowledge space is more efficient than the original multi-granularity knowledge space.

This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion. • Cognitive system reflects interaction of computational processes. • Computational framework is based on theory of combinators. • Setting up computing invariants. • Processes of bi-directional object conversion. • Synthesis of objects with given combinatory characteristic. • Modeling the plurality of the worlds of combinators.

This understanding is crucial for assessing threats to these systems and leveraging their biotechnological applications. Given that temporal dynamics are linked to community functioning, this study investigated the drivers of community succession in the wine yeast community. We experimentally generated population dynamics data and used it to create an interpretable model with a gradient boosted regression tree approach. The model was trained on temporal data of viable species populations in various combinations, including pairs, triplets, and quadruplets, and was evaluated for predictive accuracy and input feature importance. Key findings revealed that the inoculation dosage of non- Saccharomyces species significantly influences their performance in mixed cultures, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae consistently dominates regardless of initial abundance. Additionally, we observed multispecies interactions where the dynamics of Wickerhamomyces anomalus were influenced by Torulaspora delbrueckii in pairwise cultures, but this interaction was altered by the inclusion of S. cerevisiae. This study provides insights into yeast community succession and offers valuable machine learning-based analysis techniques applicable to other microbial communities, opening new avenues for harnessing microbial communities.

Sorting is a widely used sensory method; however, it provides limited information about the uniqueness of individual products. The present work was performed on nine single‐hop beers using a combination of sorting with profiling and intensity rating (SPIR) rating to highlight the intra‐group variability and individual characteristics. Results have shown that SPIR can effectively highlight the intra‐group differences. It has also shown that a higher frequency of citation did not always correspond to a higher attribute intensity. For the considered application, the results highlighted the role of hop varieties on the sensory profile of beers. Overall sensory similarities were found between Mosaic (MO), Citra (CI), and Celeia (CE) hops. However, the use of SPIR highlighted differences between CE and the other hops. Amarillo (AM) hops showed the most distinctive profile in all cases. Practical applications: The use of sorting in combination with profiling and intensity rating (SPIR) rating can be a valuable tool in new product development. It is not only important to understand the overall sensory similarities and differences between groups of samples, but also unique aspects compared to similar products. The present work has shown that adding intensity to sorting and profiling can highlight the inner characteristics of individual products in a group of samples with an overall similar sensory profile.

Yet, the short-term effects of altered nutrient regimes on the diversity and function of soil microbiota in polyextreme environments such as Antarctica, remains poorly understood. We studied these effects by constructing soil microcosms simulating augmented carbon, nitrogen, and moisture. Addition of nitrogen significantly decreased the diversity of Antarctic soil microbial assemblages, compared with other treatments. Other treatments led to a shift in the relative abundances of these microbial assemblages although the distributional patterns were random. Only nitrogen treatment appeared to lead to distinct community structural patterns, with increases in abundance of Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobateria) and a decrease in Verrucomicrobiota (Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobiae).The effects of extracellular enzyme activities and soil parameters on changes in microbial taxa were also significant following nitrogen addition. Structural equation modeling revealed that nutrient source and extracellular enzyme activities were positive predictors of microbial diversity. Our study highlights the effect of nitrogen addition on Antarctic soil microorganisms, supporting evidence of microbial resilience to nutrient increases. In contrast with studies suggesting that these communities may be resistant to change, Antarctic soil microbiota responded rapidly to augmented nutrient regimes.

The model's statistical performance is linked to specific parameters, while the interpretation of the results in the context of the problem often relies on visualisation aids. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical pipeline to interpret a multiblock data fusion model using visualisation aids that combine dendrogram and scatterplot projections of model decomposition and variable/observation contributions. Two case studies were used, based on craft products (beer and gin). Sensory attributes, as well as targeted and untargeted chemical data were fused using multiple factor analysis (MFA) and the results subjected to agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The results are presented from the perspective of the model building process during which certain stop/go stages and criteria are discussed. The results are also presented from the perspective of the two case studies to illustrate how the chosen visualisations add value to the interpretation in context. The results showed that the products were not clustered according to any of the categories used to identify them (e.g. style, region, country, etc.) in each of the three data blocks as well as in the fused model. Thus, any supervised analysis to classify products according to these categories could not be pursued.

Here, we show the impact of ENPs on the physical and chemical properties of soils. A literature search was performed in the Scopus database using the keywords ENPs, plus soil physical properties or soil chemical properties, and elements availability. In general, we found that the presence of metal and metallic oxide ENPs in soils can increase hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity and reduce the distance between soil particles, as well as causing a variation in pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), redox potential (Eh), and soil organic matter (SOM) content. Furthermore, ENPs or the metal cations released from them in soils can interact with nutrients like phosphorus (P) forming complexes or precipitates, decreasing their bioavailability in the soil solution. The results depend on the soil properties and the doses, exposure duration, concentrations, and type of ENPs. Therefore, we suggest that particular attention should be paid to every kind of metal and metallic oxide ENPs deposited into the soil.

In particular, the immobilization of nZVI particles onto inorganic and organic substrates (nanocomposites) decreased its agglomeration, allowing them to be effective and achieve greater adsorption of pollutants than pristine nanoparticles (NPs). Although nZVI began to be used around 2004 to remove pollutants, there are no comprehensive review studies about phosphate removal from aquatic systems to date. For this reason, this study will show different types of nZVI, pristine nZVI, and its nanocomposites, that exist on the market, how factors such as pH solution, oxygen, temperature, doses of adsorbent, initial phosphate concentration, and interferents affect phosphate adsorption capacity, and mechanisms involved in phosphate removal. We determined that nanocomposites did not always have higher phosphate adsorption than pristine nZVI particles. Moreover, phosphate can be removed by nZVI-based nanoadsorbents through electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, chemisorption, reduction, complexation, hydrogen bonding, and precipitation mechanisms. Using the partition coefficient (PC) values, we found that sepiolite-nZVI is the most effective nanoadsorbent that exists to remove phosphate from aqueous systems. We suggest future studies need to quantify the PC values for nZVI-based nanoadsorbents as well as ought to investigate their phosphate removal efficiency under natural environmental conditions.

Data fusion, especially integrating data sets, is important when working with complex systems. The success reported when trying to integrate different modalities is generally low and has been attributed to the lack of statistically considerate strategies focusing on the data handling process. Multiple stages of data handling must be carefully considered when dealing with multi-modal data. In this review, the different stages in the data analysis process were examined. The study revealed misconceptions surrounding the process and elucidated rules for purpose-driven approaches by examining the complexities of each stage and the impact the decisions made at each stage have on the resulting models. The two major modeling approaches are either supervised (discrimination, classification, prediction) or unsupervised (exploration). Supervised approaches were emphatic on the pre-processing steps and prioritized increasing performance. Unsupervised approaches were mostly used for preliminary steps. The review found aspects often neglected when it came to the data collection and capturing which in the end contributed to the low success in combining sensory and chemistry data.

However, design feedback is often met with resistance, which counteracts its potential to help novice designers evaluate their design and generate new solution directions. In this paper, we report on the construction and utilization of a design feedback intervention during a real-life design project with a group of primary school children (aged 8–12). The goal of the intervention was to stimulate young novice designers' creative thinking by guiding the design feedback dialogues with their peers and clients. The intervention was designed according to the following key principles: (1) guide towards a shared understanding of the design through low-level convergent feedback, (2) stimulate critical reflection and evaluation of the design to help identify and internalize possible shortcomings through high-level convergent feedback, and (3) provide a way to move forward by guiding new generative thoughts through high-level divergent feedback. Overall, the results show that the intervention can support young novice designers, their peers, and clients in engaging in constructive feedback dialogues, thereby stimulating their creative thinking. Our main contribution entails a detailed understanding of the successes and obstacles within the feedback dialogues, as guided by the intervention. Based on these results, we propose a set of refined design principles to inform feedback interventions. With this research we hope to give insight in the complexity of design feedback dialogues, while also inspiring design educators to actively try out these key principles.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented to reduce the feature space of each dataset. Following that process, 17 and 22 relevant attributes were picked from the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively. The accuracy obtained through the test subsets was used as the main performance metric in conjunction with the F1-Score, the validation accuracy, and the training time (in seconds). The results showed that for the binary classification tasks using the NSL-KDD, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved the best performance with a test accuracy (TAC) of 88.13%, a validation accuracy (VAC) of 99.49% and a training time of 225.46 s. For the UNSW-NB15, the XGBoost-Simple-RNN was the most efficient model with a TAC of 87.07%. For the multiclass classification scheme, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved a TAC of 86.93% over the NSL-KDD and the XGBoost-GRU obtained a TAC of 78.40% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset. These results demonstrated that our proposed IDS framework performed optimally in comparison to existing methods.

While prior investigations have predominantly focused on qubits, our research extends this inquiry to higher-dimensional systems. We introduce a novel, state-independent framework based on the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism to evaluate the performance of the Petz map. By analyzing different channels and the (non-)unital nature of these processes, we emphasize the pivotal role of the reference state selection in determining the map's effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the considerable impact of suboptimal choices on performance, prompting a broader consideration of factors such as system dimensionality. • Performance of the Petz map for qudit channels. • Introduction of a state-independent framework that facilitates the extension to higher dimensions. • Robustness of the Petz map for higher dimensions.

"The Hiking Optimization Algorithm: A novel human-based metaheuristic approach.","Oladejo, Sunday O.; Ekwe, Stephen O.; Mirjalili, Seyedali","Knowledge-Based Systems",="09507051",,="Jul2024","296",,"N.PAG","1","177601540","10.1016/j.knosys.2024.111880","Elsevier B.V.","Article",,"Algorithm; Benchmark; Hiking; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Problem solving; Tobler's Hiking function","In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called 'The Hiking Optimization Algorithm' (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA's mathematical model is premised on Tobler's Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers' positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA's performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman's and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA's results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn's post hoc test for the performance evaluation. HOA's results are competitive and, in many instances, outperform the aforementioned well-known metaheuristics.

This paper presents the Collaborative Design Thinking (CoDeT) co-design approach, its theoretical framework, and its application in a case study with 49 children aged 9 to 10 in two schools. CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach. CoDeT was first applied in a case study and yielded promising results in terms of children's collaboration and design thinking skills, yet possible improvements were found. The insights of this case study informed the revised version of CoDeT presented at the end of this article, in a what-why-how structure, allowing researchers and practitioners to apply the co-design approach in a wide variety of contexts characterised by high child-to-adult ratios.

"Effect of particle size of nanoscale zero–valent copper on inorganic phosphorus adsorption–desorption in a volcanic ash soil.","Suazo-Hernández, Jonathan; Urdiales, Cristian; Poblete-Grant, Patricia; Pesenti, Hector; Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Sarkar, Binoy; Bolan, Nanthi; de la Luz Mora, María","Chemosphere",="00456535",,="Nov2023","340",,"N.PAG","1","171827649","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139836","Elsevier B.V.","Article","SANTA Barbara (Calif.); ANDOSOLS; ADSORPTION (Chemistry); SOIL absorption & adsorption; METALLIC oxides; ADSORPTION isotherms; COPPER","Adsorption models; Agricultural soil; Emerging pollutants; Engineered nanoparticles; Inorganic elements","Zero–valent copper engineered nanoparticles (Cu–ENPs) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (IP) to plants. In this study, we used adsorption–desorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) on IP availability in Santa Barbara (SB) volcanic ash soil. X–Ray Diffraction results showed that Cu–ENPs were formed by a mixture of Cu metallic and Cu oxides (Cu 2 O or/and CuO) species, while specific surface area values showed that Cu–ENPs/25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm. The kinetic IP adsorption of SB soil without and with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudo–second–order (k 2 = 0.45–1.13 x 10−3 kg mmol−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.999, and RSS ≤ 0.091) and Elovich (α = 14621.10–3136.20 mmol kg−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.984, and RSS ≤ 69) models. Thus, the rate–limiting step for IP adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms without Cu–ENPs were fitted well to the Freundlich model, while with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm), isotherms were described best by the Freundlich and/or Langmuir model. The IP relative adsorption capacity (K F) was higher with 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm (K F = 110.41) than for 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm (K F = 74.40) and for SB soil (K F = 48.17). This study showed that plausible IP retention mechanisms in the presence of 1% Cu–ENPs in SB soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) co–precipitate formation. The desorption study demonstrated that 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm increased the affinity of IP in SB soil with a greater effect than 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm. Thus, both the studied size ranges of Cu–ENPs could favor an accumulation of IP in volcanic ash soils. [Display omitted] • IP adsorption on SB soil was higher with Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm than with Cu–ENPs/25 nm. • IP adsorption on SB soil with Cu–ENPs (25 nm or 40–60 nm) reached equilibrium in 720 min. • IP desorption from SB soil was lower with Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm than with Cu–ENPs/25 nm. • Retention mechanisms with Cu–ENPs (25 nm or 40–60 nm) in SB soil were ligand exchange, electrostatic attraction, and co–precipitate formation.

Sample preparation conditions and method performance were evaluated. Precision ranged from 1% to 10% for beer and 2–12% for gin, accuracy from 84 % to 118% for beer and 10–124% for gin. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for beer ranged from 0.04 to 6 µg/L and 0.1–19 µg/L respectively. LOD and LOQ for gin ranged from 0.02 to 2.3 µg/L and 0.05–7.5 µg/L respectively. In addition, the stability of selected terpenoids (as class representatives) was assessed in a synthetic beer using a targeted and non-targeted approach at various temperatures (4, 25 and 50C) over 40 days. The optimized method was successfully applied to commercial craft beers (n = 34) and gins (n = 21). The main contributors to the beer profile were β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, and geraniol, and for gin 1,8-cineole, cis-rose oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, valencene, and citronellol. This first report of such a large number of terpenoids determined in one run and quantified using authentic standards can make a significant contribution to the knowledge of products that require a fast and accurate terpenoid screening method.
